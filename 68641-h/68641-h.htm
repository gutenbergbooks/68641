INTRODUCTION.
</p>

<p>
Here is a fairy tale which I found in an old Hindoo
manuscript.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
As the title shows, it is a solar myth.  Literally
translated, its name is: <i>The glory of the Going Down of the
Sun</i>.  But this is only the exoteric, physical envelope
of the inner, mystical meaning, which is: <i>The Divine
Lustre[<a id="chap00fn1text"></a><a href="#chap00fn1">1</a>] of the Descent</i> (Incarnation) <i>of Him Who took
Three Steps</i>: i.e. Wishnu, or the Sun, the later Krishna,
or Hindoo Apollo.  And this epithet of the Sun is
explained by the well-known passage in the Rig-Weda
(I. 22. 17[<a id="chap00fn2text"></a><a href="#chap00fn2">2</a>]), '<i>Three steps did Wishnu stride: thrice did
he set down his foot.</i>'  A mythological expression for
the rise, the zenith, and the set of the Sun.  But the
old magnificent simplicity of the Rig-Weda was
perverted by subsequent Pauranik glosses; and Wishnu,
according to the new legend, was said to have cheated
his adversary, Bali, by striding, in his Dwarf Incarnation,
over the three worlds.  In our title, a different
turn is given to the old idea, which we may express by
saying that the steps commence, not with the rise,
but the set of the Sun: his Going Down, his mysterious
period of Darkness, his Rising again.  This is the
inverted Race, or Cycle of the Sun, which so much
exercised the mind of primitive man, and seemed to be
a symbol of the mystery of Birth and Death.
</p>

<p>
And ours is a strange story; which seemed to the
translator not unworthy of being clothed in an English dress,
containing as it did so much in little bulk that, as the
French say, <i>donne à penser</i>.  Absolutely Hindoo in its
form and spirit, it is for an Englishman full of
associations, and instinct with that philosophical mythology,
scraps and fragments of which are familiar to him in
the story of the Fall and the poetry of Milton, in many
an old fairy tale, in some touches of Pythagoras and
Plato, and some old religious legends.  <i>Lux in tenebris</i>:
a dazzling light, in the most profound darkness: the
night of the sun: a heavenly body, doomed to put
on mortality and suffer for a period in this lower world
of darkness, birth and death: in some such ways as
these we may express its central idea.  But for the reader
not acquainted with Sanskrit it may be worth while
to point out that there runs throughout it a veiled
allegory which he would not be apt to detect, to the
teaching of the Sánkhya Philosophy of Kapila, (who
is older than Thales;) according to which it is the
duty of PURUSHA, the archetype of the spirit of man,
the Primæval Male, to hunt for and pursue PRAKRITI,
the feminine personification of material Nature, the
Eternal Feminine, till he finds her: when instantly
she disappears 'like an actress[<a id="chap00fn3text"></a><a href="#chap00fn3">3</a>].'  In this respect,
the story somewhat recalls the <i>Gita-Gowind</i> of
Jayadewa, which according to one school of interpreters,
deals with the Soul, personified as the lovely Rádhá,
in its search after the Divine.  For among the Hindoos,
the earthly and the heavenly love are always
confounded.
</p>

<p>
And let not anyone suppose, that the lesson embodied
in these pages is obsolete or dead in the India of to-day.
I wrote the last lines of this translation late one evening,
and I walked out in the dusk to the bridge across the
river, about half a mile away.  There was not a breath
of air.  It was a night as still as that which long ago
Medea chose on which to work her spells: nothing
moved save the twinkling stars; all below was plunged
in sleep, every tree a picture, every leaf seemed carved
in stone: only, every now and then, a flying fox burst
screeching from a branch.  And as I stood upon the
bridge, I could hear a faint din of tom-toms coming from
the distant city of the Peshwas.  I looked westwards, up
the river.  The sun had set, leaving behind it a ruddy
glare which faded higher up the sky into the darkness:
and exactly on the confines of the colours, in that bath
of <i>nilalohita</i>, that <i>purple-red</i>, which is a favourite epithet
of the god Shiwa, hung, like a thing in a dream, the
lovely streak of the new moon, one day old.  All was
reflected in the still mirror of the broad sheet of water
formed by the river <i>Bund</i>, or dam.
</p>

<p>
I turned round.  On the eastern side, below the bridge,
the river runs in disconnected pools.  All was buried in
dark and gloom.  But about two hundred yards away,
on the right bank, there was a red spot and leaping
flames.  They were burning on the bank a corpse, whose
former owner had died of plague.  For here in Poona
it is now, as it was of old in the days of Homer,
[Greek: aieì dè puraì nekúon kaíonto thameiaí ....]
</p>

<p>
Suddenly a voice said behind me: They burn well
on a cold night.  I looked round.  Beside me stood a
Hindoo, whose real name I do not think it lawful to
mention.  His white clothes were stained and splashed
all over with red, for the Holi festival had left its mark
on him.
</p>

<p>
Why, Wishwanáth, I said, what are you doing here?
Or have you come, like me, merely <i>dekhne ke wáste</i>, to
see the sun set, and 'eat air'?
</p>

<p>
Wishwanáth cast a careless glance at the sky.  Yes,
he said, it looks well from here: but then I have seen
it so often.  It was a new moon yesterday.
</p>

<p>
And very soon it will be old.  Look, Wishwanáth,
here is a strange thing.  See, there on that side is
the moon, following the sun to rest in a bath of fire,
and they will both appear to-morrow all the better
for it.  But now, look down there.  There is another
thing passing away in the fire.  But how will it be
with <i>that</i>?
</p>

<p>
And I pointed to the burning pyre on the other
side.
</p>

<p>
The Hindoo looked steadily at it for a moment, and
then at me.  It will be just the same, he said.
</p>

<p>
What! you think that <i>that</i> will come back again, like
sun and moon?
</p>

<p>
He did not answer for a moment.  Then he said
slowly, in a low voice, as if speaking rather to himself
than me: How should it not return? <i>na jáyate mriyate
wa kadáchit</i>[<a id="chap00fn4text"></a><a href="#chap00fn4">4</a>].
</p>

<p>
I looked at him, but said nothing.  He continued to
gaze steadily at the burning pyre, in silence, and I did
the same.  The flames were dying down: their work
was done.
</p>

<p>
Metempsychosis, transmigration, everlasting incarnation
and re-incarnation of the immortal soul in body
after body, birth after birth: all Hindoo literature is
but the kaleidoscopic reiteration of this one identical
idea, whose beauty is such that no logic will ever destroy
it or oust it in favour of another.  For the Sanskrit
language is a kind of shrine, consecrated to the
embodiment and immortalisation of this philosophical
myth.  The Hindoos are possessed by it; it is their
hereditary heirloom, <i>Kramágatam</i>, the legacy from
an immemorial past: it is all that they have left.
And nations, like the characters in our story, cling
desperately, in periods of degradation and eclipse, to all
that reminds them of a former state of ideal prosperity,
which lingers in their literature and echoes in their souls,
like dim recollections of a forgotten paradise, or faint
reminiscences of a former birth.  Distance lends
enchantment, and time effaces detail, and endows stern
realities with dreamy beauty; and thus a rugged stony
past fades gradually into a picture, blue, soft, and
unutterably beautiful, like some low barren island, seen far
away in the haze, over a hot and glittering sea.

<i>O glorious and infinite Spirit of Peace, Lord of
Ascetics, who whirling round in thy wild dance dost
lend as it were its colour to the sky, in whose mirror
are seen reflected the blueness of thy throat and the
silver digit of the moon in the matted tufts of thy
tawny hair: thee we adore.  And we worship the
ever victorious trunk of the Elephant of Elephants,
whose fierce glare consumes the innumerable hosts
of opposing obstacles, as a forest fire shrivels the
blades of dry grass</i>[<a id="chap01fn1text"></a><a href="#chap01fn1">1</a>].
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Long ago, on the slopes of Himálaya, there lived
a young King of the Spirits of the Air, named
Kamalamitra[<a id="chap01fn2text"></a><a href="#chap01fn2">2</a>]; for he was a portion of the Sun.
And he worshipped the husband of Umá[<a id="chap01fn3text"></a><a href="#chap01fn3">3</a>].  And
he turned his back on the pleasures of the senses,
and went afar off, and dwelt alone, among the icy
peaks and snowy plateaux that lie around Kailás.
And there he remained, living at first upon leaves,
and then upon smoke, and finally upon air, performing
penances of appalling severity, till after a
hundred years[<a id="chap01fn4text"></a><a href="#chap01fn4">4</a>] that Lord of Creatures was moved
to compassion.  And he appeared to him, in the
twilight of evening, in the guise of an ascetic, but in
stature like a tall tree, with the new moon in his
hair, and said: I am pleased with thy devotion,
so now I grant thee a boon: ask.  Then the young
King bowed before him, and said: Blessed One,
let me continue in this contemplation of thee: that
is enough.  Then said Maheshwara: This is well
said: nevertheless, ask of me some boon.  Then
said Kamalamitra: Since it is so, and I must
absolutely choose, then give me a wife, whose
eyes, like these hills and this sky, shall be full of
the dusky lustre[<a id="chap01fn5text"></a><a href="#chap01fn5">5</a>] of thy throat and thy moon, as
if, insatiate of gazing at thee, they had become, not
transitory mirrors, but pictures permanently stained
with thy glory.  For so shall she be a medium of
devotion between me and thee.
</p>

<p>
Then the moon-crested God was pleased.  But
he looked into the future, by his magic power of
divination, and saw what was coming.  And he
said slowly: Eyes such as these will be dangerous,
not only to others, but also to their owner.
Nevertheless, I have given thee a boon: thou shalt have
thy desire.
</p>

<p>
Then he disappeared, and Kamalamitra returned
home rejoicing.  And by the favour of the deity
all the emaciation and fatigue of his penances left
him, and he became strong as Bhima and beautiful
as Arjuna[<a id="chap01fn6text"></a><a href="#chap01fn6">6</a>].  And he arrived at his palace on the
evening of the next day, and went into the garden
to repose, as the sun was going down.  And as he
went, he looked before him, and suddenly he saw
a woman, floating on a pool of white lotuses, in
a boat of sandal, with silver oars.  And her glances
fell on those snowy flowers, and turned their tint to
blue, for her eyes were lowered: and she was
resting her chin on one hand as she lay, and with
the other dropping one by one into the water the
petals of a lotus red as blood.  And the round
curve of her hip stood up like a sand bank, and
was mirrored again in the silent water below.  And
her lips moved, for she was counting the petals as
they fell.
</p>

<p>
And Kamalamitra stood still, holding his breath,
and gazing at her, fearing to move, for he thought
it was a dream.  Then all at once she looked up
and saw him, and smiled, bathing him with the
colour of her eyes.  And it seemed to Kamalamitra
that he stood in a pool of colour formed by the
essence of all the blue lotuses in the world.  And
then suddenly he remembered the boon of the God
who is clothed with heaven[<a id="chap01fn7text"></a><a href="#chap01fn7">7</a>], and he exclaimed:
Surely thou art my own wife, sent me by the God
who keeps his promises, and none other.  For
yesterday I gazed at his glory, and now I am
gazing at thy two eyes, and it is the same.  And
if it be so, by what name shall I call thee?  Then
she said: My name is Anushayiní[<a id="chap01fn8text"></a><a href="#chap01fn8">8</a>], and for what
purpose did the Creator form these eyes, but to
reflect the image of their lord?
</p>

<p>
Then Kamalamitra, having thus obtained her
from the deity, took possession of his lovely little
wife, and thereafter remained with her in the region
about Kailás, utterly bewildered and intoxicated
by constantly gazing at those mirrors of deity, her
two great eyes.  And he plunged into their sea,
and was drowned in it, and the whole world seemed
to him to be made of lotus blue[<a id="chap01fn9text"></a><a href="#chap01fn9">9</a>].  And like a vessel
filled to the brim and running over, he was so
overflowing with delight in her beauty, and the
pride of having so unique a specimen of womankind
all to himself, that he could not contain his
emotion, but sought relief in going about everywhere
talking about her, and trying to get everybody
to acknowledge, what he thought himself, that
all other women in the world were absolutely
nothing in comparison with his own wife.  Alas! a
woman is one thing, and emancipation quite
another.
</p>

<p>
So it happened, that on a day, when he was
disputing about her with one of his friends, and
abusing him, for not readily admitting all his own
eulogies of his wife, that friend of his suddenly
burst out laughing, and exclaimed: For all things
there is a cure, even for snake-bite there is a cure,
but there is no cure, for one who has been bitten
with a woman's beauty.  Know, O thou infatuated
lover, that the golden glamour of our Other Half,
Man's ectype, Woman, is not like a simple musical
theme, but one infinitely various, containing ten
thousand notes, and stirring like a churning stick
all the emotions in the ocean of the soul of man.
And however beautiful may be thy wife's eyes,
still eyes are only eyes, and a woman is not all
eye, but something more.  For one woman witches
us, like a waterfall, with the music of her bubbling
laughter, and another entrances us, like a forest-pool,
with the peace of her shadowy silence.  And
one entangles us, like Yama[<a id="chap01fn10text"></a><a href="#chap01fn10">10</a>], in the nectar-nooses
of her hair, while another pierces us, like Manobhawa[<a id="chap01fn11text"></a><a href="#chap01fn11">11</a>]
with the archery of her poisoned eyes.  And
one enflames us, like the Sun, in the fever-fire of sick
desire, while another soothes us, like the Moon, by
<a id="p9"></a>
the camphor of her dewy kisses.  And like oxen,
we are goaded, by the biting sting of one woman's
evil, and like elephants, we are tamed, by the subtle
spell of another's purity; and like birds, we are
decoyed, by the lure of the bower of one girl's
arms, and like bees, we hover and sip, around the
honey of another's lips, and like snakes, we wind
and coil[<a id="chap01fn12text"></a><a href="#chap01fn12">12</a>] round the slender stem of one girl's waist,
and like weary travellers, we long to sleep on the
living pillow of another's bosom.  Then Kamalamitra
broke in impatiently: Away with the fascinations,
of all the women in the three worlds, past, present,
or to come!  Could they unite to form the very
body of the god of love, yet the eyes of Anushayiní,
alone, would, like the eye of the enemy of
Kaudarpa[<a id="chap01fn13text"></a><a href="#chap01fn13">13</a>], reduce them to ashes.  Aye! those eyes,
with their blue irresistible invitation, would succeed
in corrupting sages, where Menaká, Tilottamá[<a id="chap01fn14text"></a><a href="#chap01fn14">14</a>] and
the rest had failed.
</p>

<p>
Then his friend laughed in derision, and said:
Boasting is useless, and in words, all men can do
everything, and every woman is another Rambhá[<a id="chap01fn15text"></a><a href="#chap01fn15">15</a>].
Babble no more of her beauty, but come, let your
paragon of a wife put her power to the proof.  For
hard by here, in the wood on the hillside, is an aged
Sage, named Pápanáshana[<a id="chap01fn16text"></a><a href="#chap01fn16">16</a>], whose austerities terrify
even the gods.  He would be an admirable touchstone
for the eyes of this wonderful wife of yours,
whose beauty exists, like a bubble, only on the
stream of your words.
</p>

<p>
And then, stung by the taunt, Kamalamitra
exclaimed in wrath: Fool! if she does not turn him
from his asceticism as easily as amber draws after
it stubble and grass, I will cut off my own head and
cast it into the Ganges.  Then his friend laughed
again, and said: Do nothing rash, thou art not
Daksha[<a id="chap01fn17text"></a><a href="#chap01fn17">17</a>]: once gone, thy head can never be
restored.  But Kamalamitra hurried away to find
Anushayiní.  And he found her in the garden by the
lotus pool, and told her of his brag, and said:
Come instantly, and make the experiment, and vindicate
the power of those wonderful eyes of thine, and
my own faith in them, without delay.  For I burn to
convict that foolish sceptic of his folly, by ocular
demonstration.
</p>

<p>
Then Anushayiní said slowly: Dear husband, thou
wert angry, and therefore indiscreet, and I fear, lest
by doing evil we may bring on ourselves punishment.
For expiation follows guilt, as surely as Orion
treads on the heels of Rohini[<a id="chap01fn18text"></a><a href="#chap01fn18">18</a>].  There is sin and
danger in this rash experiment.  And now it will
be better for us not to venture upon the verge of
a precipice, over which we may both fall, into
irreparable disaster.
</p>

<p>
But as she spoke, her eyes rested on Kamalamitra,
and bewildered him, and destroyed the persuasion
of her words.  For he heard nothing that she said,
but was full of the blindness of passion, and more
than ever convinced of the omnipotence of her
beauty.  And so, seeing that she could not turn
him from his will, Anushayiní gave in, and yielded
to him as to her deity.  Nay, in the interior of
her heart she rejoiced, to find that she could not
dissuade him, for she was filled with curiosity
herself, to see whether in truth her beauty would
prevail over the ascetic, though she trembled for
the consequences.  Alas! where beauty, and curiosity,
and youth, and self-will, and intoxication combine,
like a mad elephant, where is the cotton thread
of self-control?
</p>

<p>
Then those two lovers kissed each other passionately,
like travellers who have been separated for
a year.  And yet they knew not that they were
doing so for the last time.  And then they went
together to the forest, to find that old ascetic.  And
hand-in-hand they rambled about, like a pair of
Love's arrows in human form[<a id="chap01fn19text"></a><a href="#chap01fn19">19</a>], till they penetrated
to the very heart of that wood.  And there on a
sudden they came upon that old sage, and saw
him standing, plunged in meditation, motionless
as a tree.  And round him the ants had built up
their hills, and his beard and hair trailed from his
head, like creepers, and ran down along the ground,
and were covered with leaves: and over his withered
limbs played a pair of lizards, like living emeralds.
And he looked straight before him, with great eyes
that mirrored everything, but saw nothing, clear and
unfathomable and still, like mountain tarns in which
all the fish are asleep.
</p>

<p>
And Kamalamitra and Anushayiní looked at him
awhile in silence, and then at each other, and
trembled, for they knew that they were staking
their souls.  But as he wavered, the thought of his
friend's derision came back into Kamalamitra's
mind, and filled him with anger.  And he said to
Anushayiní: Advance, and let this old <i>muni</i>[<a id="chap01fn20text"></a><a href="#chap01fn20">20</a>] see
you, and I will mark the result.
</p>

<p>
So Anushayiní went forward, obeying his command,
and stepped over the leaves with feet lighter
than themselves, till she stood in front of the sage.
And when she saw that he did not move, she raised
herself on tiptoe to look into his eyes, saying to
herself: Possibly he is dead.  And she looked into
those eyes, and saw there nothing save two images
of herself, like two incarnations of timidity, that
seemed to say to her as it were: Beware!  And as
she stood there, trembling in the swing of
uncertainty, Kamalamitra watched her with ecstasy,
and laughed to himself; and said: Certainly that
old <i>muni</i> is no longer alive, for otherwise she would
have reached his soul through the door of his eyes,
were it down in the lower world.
</p>

<p>
So as they stood there, waiting, gradually that
old sage came to himself: for he felt that his
meditations were being disturbed by something or other.
And he looked, and saw Anushayiní standing before
him like the new moon at the close of day, a pure
form of exquisite beauty[<a id="chap01fn21text"></a><a href="#chap01fn21">21</a>], a crystal without a flaw,
tinged with the colour of heaven.  And instantly,
by the power of his own mystical meditation, he
divined the whole truth, and the exact state of
the case.  And he cast at that wayward beauty a
glance, sorrowful as that of a deer, yet terrible as
a thunderbolt: and immediately courage fled from
her soul, and strength from her knees, and she sank
to the ground with drooping head, like a lotus
broken by the wind.
</p>

<p>
But Kamalamitra rushed forward, and caught her
in his arms.  Then as they stood together, the old
ascetic spoke and cursed them, saying slowly:
Irreverent lovers, now shall that beauty which
occasioned this insolence meet with its appropriate
reward.  Descend now, ye guilty ones, into mortal
wombs, and suffer in the lower world the pangs
of separation, till ye have purged away your guilt
in the fire of human sorrow.
</p>

<p>
Then hearing the doom of separation, wild with
grief they fell at his feet, and implored him, saying:
Fix at least a term to the curse, and a period to
our pain.  And he said again: When one of you
shall slay the other, the curse shall end.
</p>

<p>
Then those two unhappy lovers looked at each
other in mute despair.  And they drew in that
instant from each other's eyes a deep draught of
the nectar of mutual contemplation, as if to sustain
them in their pilgrimage over the terrible sea of
separation, saying as it were to each other, but
in vain[<a id="chap01fn22text"></a><a href="#chap01fn22">22</a>]: Remember me!  Then all of a sudden
they disappeared and went, like flashes of lightning,
somewhere else.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
But Maheshwara, from his seat on Kailás, saw
them go, for as fate would have it, he chanced to
be looking in that direction.  And grasping the
whole truth by mystical intuition[<a id="chap01fn23text"></a><a href="#chap01fn23">23</a>], he remembered
his boon to the Spirit of the Air, and he said to
himself: Now has the future which I foresaw
become the present[<a id="chap01fn24text"></a><a href="#chap01fn24">24</a>], and the blue eyes of Anushayiní
have produced a catastrophe.  But I must
not leave her lovely body to the play of chance,
for it has in it something of my own divinity.  And
Kamalamitra, after all, was not very much to blame.
For he was bewildered by my glory, reflected in
her eyes.  So I am the culprit, who is responsible
for this state of affairs: and so I must look after
this pair of lovers.  Moreover, I have a mind to
amuse myself with their adventures[<a id="chap01fn25text"></a><a href="#chap01fn25">25</a>].
</p>

<p>
So after considering awhile, that Master Yogi
took a lotus, and placing it on the earth in a
distant sea, it became an island.  And he made in
it, by his magic power, an earthly copy of a
heavenly type, of a nature known to himself alone, for
the future to unfold.  And having completed his
arrangements, he allowed the chain of events to
take its course.
</p>

<p>
But the old sage Pápanáshana, when those two
lovers had disappeared, remained in the forest
alone.  And their images forsook the mirror of his
eyes, and faded away from his mind, like the
shadow of a cloud travelling over the surface of
a great lake, and vanished, and were utterly
forgotten.

<p>
But Anushayiní[<a id="chap0201fn1text"></a><a href="#chap0201fn1">1</a>], when she disappeared in the
forest, fell down to earth like a falling star, and
entered the womb of the favourite wife of the
King of Indirálaya[<a id="chap0201fn2text"></a><a href="#chap0201fn2">2</a>], and was born after the
manner of mortals as his daughter.  And at that
moment she lit up the birth chamber with the
radiance diffused from her body, which put the
lamps to shame.  And the nurses and waiting
women were astonished, for wonderful to say! the
lids of the child's eyes were fringed with long
black lashes, looking like rain-clouds hanging low
to hide the rising moon.  And suddenly those
lashes rose like a curtain, and there came from
beneath them a flood of blue colour, which
pervaded the room like the odour of camphor and
sandal-wood made visible to the eye, and
overcame the senses of all that stood by, till they were
within a little of swooning away.  And like men
lying on their backs and gazing into the depths
of the sky, they felt as it were enveloped in the
colour of heaven, and lost their perception of
mundane affairs.  For though they knew it not,
they were looking at the reflection of the glory
of the moon-crested god.
</p>

<p>
So they all stood round in silence, watching the
child's eyes.  And at last, the King, and his ministers,
and his physicians and astrologers, drew a long
breath, and looked at each other in amazement.
And the prime-minister said: King, this is a
wonderful thing.  For these eyes are the eyes, not of
a child, but of a sage[<a id="chap0201fn3text"></a><a href="#chap0201fn3">3</a>], or rather, of a god.  And
surely this is no mere mortal maiden, but rather
some deity, or portion of a deity, smitten by a
curse, and doomed thereby to descend for a period
into this lower world, to expiate awhile sins
committed in a former birth.  For such things often
come about,  And beyond a doubt your Majesty
is favoured, in being chosen by the deity to be the
means of his incarnation.  Then hearing this speech
of his minister, whose words were always suited
to the events, the King was excessively delighted.
And he celebrated the birth of his daughter with
extraordinary magnificence, and gave gold and
villages to Brahmans and the poor.  And taking
counsel with his astrologers and Brahman sages
skilled in names and their applications, he gave
to his daughter the auspicious name of Shrí[<a id="chap0201fn4text"></a><a href="#chap0201fn4">4</a>].
For he said: Her eyes are like lotuses, and like
the pools in which they dwell: and surely they
are the very echo of the eyes of the Goddess of
Beauty when she rose from the sea, and lay in her
blue lotus cradle, lapped by the foam of which
she was composed, and gazing at the wondering
waves with eyes that mocked them, and robbed
them of their hue.
</p>

<p>
Then time passed away, and the years with the
seasons followed each other like caravans over the
desert, and old age and grey hair came and took
up their dwelling at the wrinkled root of the King's
ear.  And meanwhile Shrí grew from a child into
a girl, and at length the dawn of her womanhood
broke.  And like the horns of the waxing moon,
her limbs rounded and swelled into the very perfect
orb of supreme loveliness, and she became as it
were the very salt of the sea of beauty[<a id="chap0201fn5text"></a><a href="#chap0201fn5">5</a>], inspiring
in all who drank of it insatiable thirst, and an
intolerable craving for the water of the blue lakes of
her eyes.  And at last there came a day when the
King her father looked at her, and said to himself:
The fruit is ripe: and now it is time that it were
plucked and eaten.
</p>

<p>
So he went to the apartments of the women, to
find her mother, his principal Queen, Madirekshaná[<a id="chap0201fn6text"></a><a href="#chap0201fn6">6</a>].
But when she learned the object of his coming, the
Queen said: <i>Aryaputra</i>[<a id="chap0201fn7text"></a><a href="#chap0201fn7">7</a>], it is useless.  For our
daughter will not even listen to the word husband,
much less undergo the thing.  The King said: What
is this?  Should the cornfield refuse the plough, or
a maiden refuse to be married?  Is she not now
of ripe age, and does not a grown-up maiden in the
house bring upon herself and her relations infamy
in this world and the next?  Madirekshana said:
Speak to her yourself, and persuade her to it if you
can.  For of her own accord she told me, that her
marriage was a thing not to be thought of, even in
a dream.
</p>

<p>
So the King sent for his daughter, to question her
himself.
</p>

<p>
And after a while, Shrí came in, undulating as she
moved like a swan[<a id="chap0201fn8text"></a><a href="#chap0201fn8">8</a>], and swaying like a flower
waving in the wind: for her waist could be grasped by
the fist, and her bosom was glorious, like the swell
of an ocean wave.  And like a child she smiled
at her father[<a id="chap0201fn9text"></a><a href="#chap0201fn9">9</a>] with parted lips and half-shut eyes,
casting before her through the net of their lashes
the magical charm of the colour of a wet lotus: and
her girdle jingled as if with joy, while the flashing
jewels with which she was covered all over changed
colour, as if with envy at being outshone by the
play[<a id="chap0201fn10text"></a><a href="#chap0201fn10">10</a>] of her eyes.  And the old King looked at her
with pride and wonder and delight: and he laughed
to himself, and said: Wonderful is the cunning
of the Creator, and incomprehensible the mystery
of a woman's beauty!  For I am old, and I am her
father, and yet I feel before her like a domestic
servant in the presence of a ruler of the world.
Surely she would drive a young man into madness
and ecstasy.  And did the Creator, forsooth! form
this incarnation of the intoxication of woman to
no purpose?  Surely she is a husband's ideal
correlative in human form!  And then he said to her:
My daughter, it is high time that you were married:
for an unmarried daughter is a scandal in her father's
house.
</p>

<p>
Then said Shrí: Dear father, do not speak thus.
Let me live and die a maiden, for I do not wish
to be married[<a id="chap0201fn11text"></a><a href="#chap0201fn11">11</a>].  The King said: Daughter, what
is this that you are saying?  Is not a husband
the very object of your birth?  Shrí said: Do not
even dream of a husband for me.  And there is a
reason for this: for I am different from other
maidens.  And hearing this, the King was
perplexed.  And he looked at Shrí under his brows,
and said to himself: She speaks truth.  Certainly
this daughter of mine, if she be mine[<a id="chap0201fn12text"></a><a href="#chap0201fn12">12</a>], is not like
other maidens.  For who ever saw her equal in
beauty, or who ever heard of a maiden objecting to
be married[<a id="chap0201fn13text"></a><a href="#chap0201fn13">13</a>]?  Or was my minister right, and is
she really some deity in disguise?
</p>

<p>
So day after day he continued to urge her and
argue with her.  But at last, finding that his efforts
to move her were as vain as if he were trying to
pierce a diamond with a cotton thread, he exclaimed
in dismay: Surely my crimes in a former birth were
numerous and appalling, seeing that their fruit is
a daughter, whose obstinate and unintelligible
prejudice against a husband runs counter to the nature
of woman, and will be the means of destroying my
salvation.  Then at last Shrí said: Dear father, do
not be angry, and I will tell you the truth.  Know
that I, too, wish for a husband, but only for one
husband, and no other.  Then said the King: And
who, then, is that husband?  Shrí said: I do not
know.  But he will come to claim me, from the Land
of the Lotus of the Sun[<a id="chap0201fn14text"></a><a href="#chap0201fn14">14</a>].  And where, said the King,
is the Land of the Lotus of the Sun?  Shrí said: I
cannot tell.  But in a dream I saw a lotus fall from
heaven, and I heard a divine voice saying to me: Do
not hurry, but wait: for there shall come to you a
husband, from the Land of the Lotus of the Sun.
For he was your husband in a former birth, and you
shall know him by a sign.  Then the King said:
And what is the sign?  Shrí said: I may not tell,
for it is known only to the Deity and me.  But now,
either abandon my marriage, or if you can, find me
a man who has seen the Land of the Lotus of the
Sun, of caste becoming a king's daughter, and he
shall be my husband.  For him only will I marry,
and none other.
</p>

<p>
And when the King heard this, he was astonished,
and sat silent, looking at Shrí.  And he said to
himself: This is a strange story, and the conduct of
this mysterious daughter of mine is inscrutable.
What is this Land of the Lotus of the Sun?  Is it
a fancy, the capricious dream of a girl?  Or does the
dream really point to a previous existence?  And
he thought for a while, and then he said again:
Perhaps it is better to do as she says, and endeavour to
discover a man who has seen that Land.  For where
is the harm?  For even if he is found, there will
always be time to consider.  And, moreover, in
this way it may be that she will obtain a husband,
whereas she will certainly not get married in any
other.  Better that she should get a husband, no
matter how, no matter who, than remain a maiden
to destroy us all.
</p>

<p>
Then he dismissed his daughter, and summoned
his chamberlains, and said to them: Get criers, and
send them through the city, and let them proclaim
by beat of drum: That any high caste man, who
has seen the Land of the Lotus of the Sun, shall
share my kingdom, and marry my daughter.  And
his chamberlains wondered at hearing the order.
But they went immediately, and told the criers the
order of the King.

II.
<br /><br />
By Beat of Drum
</h3>

<p>
So the criers went through the streets of the
capital, beating drums and crying aloud: <i>Whatsoever
high-caste man has been to the Land of the Lotus of the
Sun, let him come to the King: he shall share the
King's kingdom, and marry the King's daughter</i>.  And
hearing the proclamation, all the citizens and strangers
in the city marvelled as they listened.  For the
fame of the beauty of the King's daughter had gone
out into the three worlds.  And buzzing like bees,
they thronged around the criers, and ran up and
down, everybody asking everybody else: What is this
Land of the Lotus of the Sun?  Where is it, or who
has seen it?  And a great uproar arose in the streets
of the city, and they were full of noise and shouting:
and the news was carried into the neighbouring
kingdoms, and immediately crowds of people poured
into Indirálaya from every part of Málwá and the
Deckan and the North, and every quarter of the
world, and together with the merchants and the
working castes, who all abandoned their ordinary
business, gathered in knots and stood about, asking
eagerly for news of that Lotus Land, and its nature,
and its locality, and its peculiarities.  But no one
could be found who had ever even heard of it,
much less seen it.  So day by day the proclamation
sounded in the streets: and all day long the city
was full of the din of shouting criers and beaten
drums, and all night long sleep fled from the eyes
of the citizens, as if in disgust at the noise that they
made by day.  But all was in vain: for not a man
could they find, nor did anyone come forward to
say: I have seen that Lotus Country: give me the
reward.
</p>

<p>
And at last the citizens became enraged, alike
with the King, and his daughter, and the Land
of the Lotus, and themselves.  And seeing this,
the old King fell sick with anxiety: and he said
to himself: My pretty daughter is as cunning as
she is beautiful, and beyond a doubt this is some
trick devised by her, to appease me, and avoid her
bugbear of a husband, and befool us all.  And now
I fear that in their fury my subjects may break out
into revolt, and refuse to pay taxes, or depose me.
Out on my daughter and her blue eyes, and the
cunning of women and their crooked hearts!  Is
there any such land in the world, as this Land of
the Lotus of the Sun, of which in all my dominions,
haunted by merchants and strangers from every
quarter of the earth, no one has ever even so much
as heard?

<h3>
III.
<br /><br />
An Eclipse of the Sun
</h3>

<p>
Now Kamalamitra, when he was separated from
Anushayiní by the curse of the ascetic, fell down
to earth, and was born as the son of a King of
the Solar Race in a distant country.  And his father
gave him the name of Umra-Singh[<a id="chap0203fn1text"></a><a href="#chap0203fn1">1</a>], for the
astrologers said: He will live on earth like a lion,
and run over it like his rival in the sky.  And when
he grew up, there was no one in that country who
could match him in riding, or wrestling, or
swordsmanship, or any other martial exercise: so that the
people said of him: He looks like the very soul
of the nature of a Kshatriya that has assumed a
body suited to its deeds.  Surely he is an
incarnation of Kumára[<a id="chap0203fn2text"></a><a href="#chap0203fn2">2</a>], come down to earth for the
destruction of the King's enemies.  And the women
flocked around him like flies about honey, for their
hearts were trampled to pieces, like lotuses, by the
wild-elephant of his glorious youth, and their souls
were intoxicated with the nectar of the beauty of
his figure, and followed him about like captives
chained in rows.  But Umra-Singh laughed at them
all, and even outdid the moon-crested god[<a id="chap0203fn3text"></a><a href="#chap0203fn3">3</a>], in that
he drank continually the deadly poison of the
ocean of their seductions, without even staining
his throat.
</p>

<p>
Then one day his father said to him: Come, now,
I have arranged your marriage with the daughter
of my most powerful enemy: so shall we become
friends by the method of conciliation.  Umra-Singh
said: Find another bridegroom, for I have married
my sharp sword.  So his father was annoyed, and
said: What is this folly, and whence can I procure
another bridegroom?  But Umra-Singh was silent.
And three times his father repeated his words.  Then
after a while, Umra-Singh said: Bridegroom or no
bridegroom, I will not marry anybody but the lady
of my dream.  Then said his father: Who, then,
is this lady of your dream?  Umra-Singh said: I do
not know.  But every other month, on the last day
of the dark fortnight, there comes to me in a dream
a vision of a woman, floating on a pool of white
lotuses, in a boat of sandal with silver oars.  But
who she is I cannot tell, and her face I can never
see, for it is always turned away.
</p>

<p>
Then his father began to laugh, and deride him.
But Umra-Singh cared no more for the stream of
his derision than Maheshwara for the Ganges when
it fell on his head.  Then his father said: Dismiss
this delusion, and prepare for the wedding: for
I have arranged the ceremonies, and appointed the
day.  But Umra-Singh laughed, and said: Marry
her thyself: for I tell thee, I will not marry
anybody, but the lady of my dream.  Then his father
flew into a rage, and summoned his guards, and
threw the prince[<a id="chap0203fn4text"></a><a href="#chap0203fn4">4</a>] into prison, saying to himself:
He shall stay there, with his dream to keep him
company, till he learns to obey.  But Umra-Singh
persuaded his gaolers to let him escape, for the
subjects loved him more than his father.  And he
fled away by night into another country, abandoning
his royal position for the sake of his dream.
</p>

<p>
And then he went from city to city, and from one
country to another, eluding the pursuit of the agents
sent after him by his father to bring him back, till
at last he came to Indirálayá.  And he dived into
a disreputable quarter of that city, like a frog into
a well, and remained there disgusted with life and
his relations, plunging into dissipation to drown his
grief, and surrounded by gamblers and outcasts,
counting the whole world as a straw, supporting
himself on his own courage, and his dream.  And
little by little all he had melted away like snow
in the sun of his generosity, or was swallowed up
by the ocean of greedy gamblers, among whom
he scattered it with an open hand, asking, like his
ancestor[<a id="chap0203fn5text"></a><a href="#chap0203fn5">5</a>], nothing in return.  And at last, being
reduced to extremity, clad in garments worn and
ragged, which like clouds vainly obscuring the
Lord of the Day, could not hide, but rather
increased, the beauty of his form, with nothing left
to eat or drink, he determined to abandon the
body.  So taking down his sword from the wall,
and holding it in his hand, he went out of his
wretched lodging, saying to himself: Death is better
than dishonour and insignificance, hunger and the
loathing of life: for what is death but the beginning
of another life, which cannot be worse than this one,
be it what it may?  And who knows but that
I may meet her in the next life whom I dream of
in this?  For she who is but a dream now, may be
a reality in another birth, and I may discover that
lotus pool, waiting for me in another life.  Therefore
now I will go outside the city wall, and find
some deserted garden, and there I will cut off my
own head, and offer it up to Durgá as a sacrifice.
</p>

<p>
And as he stood at the door of the house, pondering
which way he should go, there fell on his ear,
for the hundredth time, the sound of the beating of
drums.  And he listened, and heard the criers
crying: <i>Whatsoever high-caste man has been to the Land
of the Lotus of the Sun, let him come to the King: he
shall share the King's kingdom, and marry the King's
daughter</i>.  And Umra-Singh laughed, and said to
himself: What! are they still looking for a man,
who has seen the Land of the Lotus of the Sun?
And how, then, did they know that there was such
a land to be seen?
</p>

<p>
And then on a sudden he started, as if he had been
bitten by a snake.  And he struck his hand on his
sword, and exclaimed: Ha!  But if nobody has ever
seen that land, and no one knows anything about
it, then, if one should come and say: Lo: I have
seen it: who could discern whether he was speaking
the truth or telling a lie?  For who can compare
the description with a reality which neither he nor
anyone else ever saw?  So what is to hinder me
from going to the King and saying: I have seen
that Lotus Land, and now, give me the reward?
For here I am, about to put myself to death; and
what greater evil can befall me at the hands of the
King, even though he should discover the deceit?
And yet, how can he?  For who knows what that
land is like, or even where it is?  But if, on the
contrary, I get credit, then I shall obtain, not only
this far-famed daughter, for whom I care nothing,
but also the resources of his kingdom; and with
them I can equip an army, and go and compel
my father to restore me to my position.  So where
is the harm? or rather, is it not pure gain, and no
loss, to make the attempt and abide the result,
whether I live or die?
</p>

<p>
Then instantly, without hesitation, he went up to
the criers, and said to them: Cease your crying, and
take me to the King, for I have seen that Lotus
Land.  But the criers, when they heard what he
said, could not believe their ears, and almost
abandoned the body from excess of joy.  For they were
almost dead from exhaustion, and continual shouting
all day long.  And they danced like peacocks at the
sight of the first cloud in the rainy season, and
caught him in their arms, holding him as if they
were afraid he would escape, to carry him away, like
a precious jewel, to the King.  And the news ran
through the city like fire in a dry wood: There
has been found a man who has seen the Land of
the Lotus of the Sun.  And a vast crowd of people
ran from every street, and pressed around him, and
accompanied him to the palace, and stood before it,
tossing like the sea, while the guards took him in
to the King.
</p>

<p>
But when the King heard the news, he wept for
joy.  And Umra-Singh seemed in his eyes like a
draught of nectar, and like the fulfilment of all his
desires in bodily form.  And he said to him: O
thou unspeakably delightful son-in-law that shall be,
hast thou really set eyes on that accursed Land of
the Lotus of the Sun?  And Umra-Singh said
boldly: Yes, I have seen it, and I know it well.
Then immediately the King in his impatience ran
himself to his daughter's apartments, and
exclaimed: The bridegroom is found, by the favour
of the Lord of Obstacles.  Here is a Rajpoot who
has seen the Land of the Lotus of the Sun.  So
prepare for the marriage without delay.
</p>

<p>
Then said Shrí: Dear father, there is no hurry
in this matter.  And how do you know that this
man is speaking the truth, or is not, rather, some
impostor, who only wishes to secure me and half
your kingdom, by falsely asserting that he has seen,
what in fact he never has seen.  For the world is
full of such crafty rogues, who go about, like cranes,
fishing in the wealth of Kings, like pools.  Bring
him therefore first to me, to examine him; and
thereafter we shall see, whether it is time to prepare
the marriage ceremonies, or not.
</p>

<p>
So the King said: Be it so.  And he sent for
Umra-Singh, and brought him into the presence of
Shrí.
</p>

<p>
And Shrí looked and saw him standing, sword
in hand, tall, and lean in the waist like a hungry
lion, with shoulders like those of a bull, and long
arms, and all the royal marks of a King.  And
she would have despised him, for his rags and
his nakedness, and yet for all that she would, she
could not, but felt herself drawn towards him against
her will.  For her heart was stirred within her at
the sight of him, and dim suggestions of that
former birth, which she had forgotten, struggled
in her soul, and strove to rise up out of its depths.
And she stood, gazing at him in silence, with eyes
that looked at him but did not see him, like those
of one that listens to the tones of a long-forgotten
voice, sounding in the hall of memory, and
awakening longing and fond regret.  And as she gazed,
she poured over him a flood of blue colour out
of her wondrous doubtful eyes.
</p>

<p>
And Umra-Singh looked at her, and the whole
world vanished from his sight in a mass of blue.
And he reeled under the blow of her glances, which
struck him mercilessly like a club, and time and
space fled from his soul, which was filled with
colour, and tears, and laughter and pain, and he
gasped for breath.  For the sight of her half-remembered
eyes clutched his heart, and stopped its
beating like an iron band.  And in that moment
there rose before him the dream-woman of the
lotus pool, and he knew that it was Shrí.
</p>

<p>
So they two stood there, like pictures painted
on a wall, gazing at each other, and groping in
vain for recollection in the darkness of oblivion[<a id="chap0203fn6text"></a><a href="#chap0203fn6">6</a>],
like shadows in a dream.  And then, after a while,
Shrí came to herself.  And she said slowly: So
thou hast seen the Land of the Lotus of the Sun?
Then mention its peculiarities, and tell me how
thou didst arrive at it.
</p>

<p>
But Umra-Singh stammered and hesitated.  For
her eyes had deprived him of his reason, and he
could think of nothing else.  And all his audacity
had vanished, and become timidity, and he faltered,
and spoke, not knowing what he said, with a voice
that refused its office, and sounded in his ears like
that of another man.  And he said: Lady, I went
I know not how, and wandered I know not how
long, among wastes and deserts and mountains I
know not how high, till I came to a land I know
not where, called the Land of the Lotus of the
Sun, I know not why[<a id="chap0203fn7text"></a><a href="#chap0203fn7">7</a>].
</p>

<p>
But as he spoke, the spell was broken, and Shrí
woke as it were from a dream.  And she saw before
her only a ragged Rajpoot, stumbling in his tale,
and abashed before her, and unable to support his
knavery even by a clever lie.  And she was ashamed,
and angry with herself, and as she listened, she was
suddenly seized with a fit of laughter.  And she
exclaimed: Hark! hark! to this high-caste hero;
listen to his lay of a Lotus Land!  He went he knew
not where, and did he knew not what, and began
at the beginning, and ended at the end.  So she
laughed and mocked him, while he stood before her
as it were in a swoon, hearing only the music of
her voice, and quailing like a coward before the
fire in her scornful eyes.
</p>

<p>
Then suddenly Shrí clapped her hands in his
face, and exclaimed: Dost thou hear, or art thou
deaf as well as dumb?  Art thou a Rajpoot, and
yet could'st thou not find courage enough to carry
out thy imposition to the end?  Strange! that such
a body could be chosen by the Creator as the
receptacle of such a soul.  And she turned to the
King, and said: Dear Father, it is as I said, and
as you see, this fellow is but a rogue.  Put him
out, therefore; and yet, do him no harm.  For
though he is a knave, yet he is a handsome knave,
and deserves rather contempt and laughter, than
punishment and blows.
</p>

<p>
Then the King said to his guards: Take this
impostor, and thrust him out into the street.  So
the guards seized Umra-Singh, who offered no
resistance, and threw him out into the street, raining
upon him as he went a shower of kicks and blows.
And immediately the criers went round the city as
before, beating drums and crying aloud: <i>Whatsoever
high-caste man has been to the Land of the Lotus
of the Sun, let him come to the King: he shall share
the King's kingdom, and marry the King's daughter</i>.

But Umra-Singh lay in the street, more like a
dead than a living man, covered with bruises and
bereft of sense.  And the people crowded round
him, jeering and scouting and pointing at him, and
giving him blows and kicks.  And he looked in the
midst of those base mockers like a black antelope
smitten by the hunters with a mortal wound, and
surrounded by a troop of chattering monkeys.  Then
by and by those scoffers left him lying, and went
every man his way, for the sun was going down.
And after a while, he came to himself, and rose
up, though with difficulty, from the ground, and
wandered away with stumbling feet, till he came
to a tank in a deserted quarter, and lay down on
its brink to rest.  And sore though he was in all
his limbs, he never felt the pain of his body: but
his eyes were dazed with the blue glory of the
bitter scorn of the eyes of Shrí, and the sound of
her voice and her laughter rang in his ears, and
in his heart was shame.  So he lay long, gazing
at the image of Shrí as it floated before him, and
stung his soul like the teeth of a serpent, and yet
soothed it like sandal, while the moon rose in
the sky.
</p>

<p>
And then suddenly he sat up, and looked round.
And he saw the tank, and the trees, and the moon's
image in the water, and remembered where he was,
and all that had occurred.  And he sighed deeply,
and said to himself: Woe is me!  I have, like a
dishonest gambler, cast my die, and lost the game.
And now, I have gained no kingdom and no King's
daughter, but only blows and shame.  Alas! no
sooner had I found my dream than again I lost
her, through the terrible operation of sins
committed in a former birth.  So now, nothing remains
but to do as quickly as possible what I was about
to do before I went to the palace, and put myself,
in very truth, to death.  For life seemed unendurable,
before I had found the woman of my dream:
but now it is worse by far, since I have found her
only to become in her eyes a thing of scorn, more
horrible than a hundred deaths.
</p>

<p>
And he took his sword, and felt the sharpness
of its edge, and put it to his throat.  And as it
touched his skin, at that moment he heard in the
silence of the night the voice of a warder, singing
as he went his round upon the city wall: <i>Whatsoever
high-caste man has been to the Land of the Lotus
of the Sun, let him come to the King: he shall share
the King's kingdom and marry the King's daughter</i>.
And the sword fell from his hand, and he sprang
to his feet, and exclaimed: What! she is for the
man who has seen the Land of the Lotus, and here
am I, a Rajpoot of the Race of the Sun, dreaming
of death by this moonlit tank, while the Land of the
Lotus is yet unfound!  Now will I find that Lotus
Country, be it where it may, and then come back
and claim her, not as I did before, in jest, but by
the right of the seer and the seen.
</p>

<p>
And instantly he picked up his sword, and threw
it into the air.  And the sword turned like a wheel,
flashing in the moonlight, and fell back to the
ground.  Then Umra-Singh took it up, and
immediately went out of the city, making for the
quarter pointed out like a finger by the blade of
his sword.

<p>
And then as a black bee roves from flower to
flower he wandered from city to city, and from
one country to another: and he went north and
east and west and south, till the elephants of the
eight quarters knew him as it were by sight.  Yet
he never found anyone who could tell him his
way, or had ever heard the name of the Land
of the Lotus of the Sun.  And meanwhile the suns
of the hot seasons burned him like a furnace, and
the cold seasons froze the blood in his veins, and
the rains roared over his head like a wild-elephant,
and at the last, he said to himself: Now for thrice
six seasons have I been seeking, and yet I know no
more of my way to the Land of the Lotus than
I did before.  And undoubtedly, if such a Land
exists in the world, it can be known only to the
birds of the air.  Therefore now I will abandon
the dwellings of men, and enter the Great Forest,
for only in this way will it ever be possible for
me to discover a land of which no human being
has ever heard.
</p>

<p>
So he went into the forest and proceeded onward,
turning his face to the south.  Then as he went the
trees grew thicker and thicker, and taller and taller,
till they shut out the light of the sun.  And at last
there came a day when he looked before him, and
saw only a darkness like that of the mouth of death:
and he looked behind him, and saw the light of
evening glimmering a great way off, as if afraid to
keep him company.  And as he went on slowly,
feeling his way with the point of his sword, suddenly
in the darkness another face peered into his own,
and stuck out at him a long red tongue.  And
Umra-Singh started back, and looked, and saw
before him a root-eating Wairágí[<a id="chap0205fn1text"></a><a href="#chap0205fn1">1</a>], clad in a coat of
bark, with long hair, and nails like the claws of
a bird, and his legs and arms were bare, and his
skin like that on the foot of an elephant.
</p>

<p>
Then said Umra-Singh: Father, what art thou
doing here, and why dost thou stick out at me thy
tongue?  The Wairágí said: Son, what art thou
doing here, in a wood full of nothing but trees and
Rákshasas[<a id="chap0205fn2text"></a><a href="#chap0205fn2">2</a>], and dark as the Hair of the Great
God, of which it is an earthly copy?  Umra-Singh
said: I am a Rajpoot who has quarrelled with his
relations, and I am looking for the Land of the
Lotus of the Sun.  Then said the Wairágí: They
are very few that wish to find that Lotus Land;
and fewer still who find it; fewest of all those, that
having found it ever return.  Then Umra-Singh said,
in astonishment: And dost thou know that Lotus
Land?  Tell me how I must go to reach it.  Then
the Wairági laughed, and said: Ha! ha!  Thou art
one more ready to ask than to answer questions:
but I give nothing for nothing.  Know, that I also
have all my life been looking, not for one way
only, but for three.  And now, if thou wilt tell me
my three ways, I will tell thee thine.
</p>

<p>
Then said Umra-Singh: One for three is no
bargain; but what, then, are thy lost ways?  The
Wairágí said: All my life I have tried to discover
the Way of the World, and the Way of Woman, and
the Way of Emancipation[<a id="chap0205fn3text"></a><a href="#chap0205fn3">3</a>], and yet could never hit
on the truth as to any one of them.  And this is
a wonderful thing.  For anything characteristic of
multitudes must be very common: and yet how can
that which is common escape the notice of all?
Tell me, then, the Way of the World, and I will
tell thee in return a third of thy way to the Land
of the Lotus of the Sun.
</p>

<p>
Then said Umra-Singh: Thou puttest a knotty
question, and drivest a hard bargain; nevertheless,
I will give thee an answer, for the sake of my own
way and the blue eyes of Shrí.  Know, that this
is the Way of the World.  There was formerly, on
the banks of Ganges, an old empty temple of Shiwa.
And one night, in the rainy season, an old female
ascetic entered the temple, to shelter herself from
the storm.  And just after her there came in an
owl for the same purpose.  Now in the roof of that
temple there lived a number of the caste[<a id="chap0205fn4text"></a><a href="#chap0205fn4">4</a>] of bats,
that never left the temple precincts, And seeing
the owl, they said to the old woman: Who art
thou, and what kind of animal is this?  Then the
old woman said: I am the Goddess Saraswatí, and
this is the peacock on which I ride[<a id="chap0205fn5text"></a><a href="#chap0205fn5">5</a>].  Then, the
storm being over, that old impostor went away.
But the owl, being pleased with the temple as a
place of residence, remained; and the bats paid
it divine honours.  Then some years afterwards, it
happened, that a real peacock entered the temple.
And the bats said to it: What kind of animal art
thou?  The peacock said: I am a peacock.  The
bats replied: Out on thee, thou impostor! what is
this folly?  The peacock said: I am a peacock,
the son of a peacock, and the carriage of the
Goddess Saraswatí is a hereditary office in our
caste.  The bats said: Thou art a liar, and the
son of a liar; dost thou know better than the
Goddess herself?  And they drove the peacock out
of the temple, and paid, as formerly, worship to
the owl.
</p>

<p>
Then said the Wairágí: Rajpoot, thou hast opened
my eyes.  Learn now from me a portion of thy own
way.  And he lay down on the ground, and
suddenly abandoning the form of a hermit, became
a weasel, which stuck out at Umra-Singh a long
red tongue, and entered the ground by a hole, and
disappeared.  And as Umra-Singh stooped down to
examine the hole, he saw the Wairágí again beside
him in his old shape, save that he continued to
stick out of his mouth the weasel's tongue.  And
he said, angrily: What is this delusion of a weasel,
and why dost thou stick out thy tongue?  Then
said the Wairágí: Ho! ho!  I have shown thee
a way for a way, and one riddle for another.  And
now, tell me the Way of a Woman, and learn yet
another third of thy own road.
</p>

<p>
Then Umra-Singh said to himself: Surely this is
no hermit, but a vile Rákshasa, who only seeks to
delude me.  Nevertheless, I will give him an answer,
for the sake of my way, and the blue light in the
eyes of Shrí.  And he said to the Wairágí: Know,
then, that the Way of a Woman is this: There dwelt
long ago, in the Windhya forest, an old Rishi.  And
the gods, being jealous of his austerities, sent to
interrupt his devotions a heavenly nymph.  Then
that old Rishi, overcome by her beauty, yielded to
the temptation, and had by her a daughter.  But
afterwards, repenting of his fall, he burned out his
eyes with a fiery cane, saying: Perish, ye causes
of perishable illusions: and so became blind.  Then
his daughter grew up alone with that old blind sage
in the forest.  And she was more beautiful than any
woman in the three worlds.  Verily, had the God of
Love seen her, he would instantly have abandoned
Rati and Príti[<a id="chap0205fn6text"></a><a href="#chap0205fn6">6</a>], counting them but as her domestic
servants.  And she dressed in bark garments, with
no mirror but the pools of the forest.  Then one
day a crow that was acquainted with cities came to
her and said: Why dost thou live here, with no
companion but an old blind father, who cannot
even see thee, and does not know the value of his
pearl?  The whole world does not contain a beauty
equal to thine.  Go and show thyself in cities, and
I tell thee, the Kings of the earth would quit their
kingdoms, and follow thee about like a swarm of
bees.  Then said the Rishi's daughter: And who,
then, would fetch for my father his sacrificial fuel,
or water to cook his cakes of rice and milk?  And
she drove away the crow, and lived on in the forest,
serving her father, and at the last became old, and
died in the forest, and no man ever saw her
face.
</p>

<p>
Then said the Wairágí: Thou foolish Rajpoot,
I asked thee for the Way of a Woman, and thou
hast told me the Way of Emancipation.  Then
said Umra-Singh: Thou miserable root-eater, since
the creation every woman has sacrificed herself
for another, or else she was not a woman, for this
is the nature of them all.  Then said the Wairágí:
Learn now from me, another portion of thy own
way.  And as Umra-Singh watched him, suddenly
that deceitful Wairágí became a bat, and stuck out
at him again his tongue, and flew away through the
trees.  And Umra-Singh said to himself: Beyond
a doubt this is no ascetic, but the very King of
Rákshasas; nevertheless, he shall tell me my road,
if he comes again, or it shall be the worse for
him.  And suddenly again he saw the Wairágí
standing by his side, and sticking out at him, as
before, his tongue.  And he said to Umra-Singh:
Now thou hast only to tell me the Way of Salvation,
and thy own way will be clear before thee.
</p>

<p>
Then said Umra-Singh: Thou art but an old
Rákshasa; nevertheless, once more will I give thee
an answer, for the sake of my way, and the colour
of the eyes of Shrí.  Know, that the Way of
Emancipation is this: There was formerly a King of
the race of the Sun, and he was very old, and all
his hair was as white as the uppermost peak of the
Snowy mountain.  And one day he looked from
his palace window, and saw in the street a child,
drawing behind it a toycart.  And the cart fell,
and was broken, and the child cried over its broken
toy.  Now it happened, by the ordinance of fate,
that long ago, when he was himself a child, exactly
the same thing had happened to that old King.
And as he looked at the child, suddenly the years
were annihilated, and became as nothing.  And
like a picture he saw before him, the image of
himself, a child.  And seized with grief, and an
unutterable longing for the repetition of his life,
he exclaimed: O Maheshwara, Maheshwara, let
me live my life again.  Then suddenly Maheshwara
stood before him, and laughed, and said:
Remember thy former births.  And suddenly memory
came upon that old King, and out of the darkness
of the past there rose before him the series of his
former lives.  And Maheshwara said: See, nine
and ninety times, in nine and ninety births, thou
hast made of me the same request, and now this
is a hundred.  And every time I have given thee
thy wish, in vain.  For every time thou hast
forgotten, and hast known the value of thy youth
only after becoming old.  Then said the old King:
How, then, can emancipation be obtained?
Maheshwara said: It depends not on time, but
knowledge: and even an instant can bring it when ten
thousand years have failed.  And thou hast but
a little left of life, yet even to thee knowledge
may come before the end.  Then he disappeared.
Now that old King had a daughter whom he loved
better than his own soul.  And, even while he
spoke with Maheshwara, she was bitten by a snake
and died, and he did not know it, for they feared
to tell him.  So he went as usual to see his
daughter.  And when he entered her room, he
looked, and saw her lying still.  And as he watched
her, there came a fly, which buzzed about her, and
settled on her lips.  Then horror came on that old
King, and illusion fell suddenly from his eyes, and
the desire of life was destroyed in him at its root.
And he turned, and went without waiting to the
Ganges, and remained there a few years washing
away his crimes, like one to whom life and death
are the same, and at last entered the river, and it
drowned him, and carried his body out to sea.
</p>

<p>
Then said the Wairágí: Now shall thou have
emancipation from thy own ignorance, as to thy
way to the Land of the Lotus of the Sun.  And
he stuck out at Umra-Singh his tongue.  But
Umra-Singh suddenly struck at him a blow of his sword,
and as luck would have it, he cut off the end of his
tongue.  And he said to him: Beware lest I kill
thee, thou old impostor.  I will waste no more
time expecting to hear from thee my way to the
Land of the Lotus, but find it in spite of thee.  Then
the Wairági suddenly assumed a terrific form, and
exclaimed: Woe to thee, thou unlucky Rajpoot.
For thou art now in the land, not of lotuses, but
of Rákshasas, of whom I am the chief.  And my
subjects shall beset thee with illusions, like the
sins of thy former birth in visible form; and there
wait for thee the Night-walkers, Ulupí, and the
Cow-killer, and the Hairy Grabber, and the Icy Chiller,
and the Flap-eared Buzzer, and the awful Watcher
in his pits of sand, and others without number[<a id="chap0205fn7text"></a><a href="#chap0205fn7">7</a>]:
and even shouldst thou escape them all, and reach
the Lotus Land, thou hast still to return.  And he
vanished with a shout of laughter, and Umra-Singh
was left alone.

VI.
<br /><br />
A Lotus of the Night
</h3>

<p>
Then he said to himself: Though I cut off the
tongue of this ill-omened Wairágí, yet he never told
me my way.  And he went on, sword in hand, along
a silver path, among trees that resembled Rákshasas,
for they let in through the hair of their branches
the light of the moon, which peered down at him
as if out of curiosity, and lit him on his way as
if in admiration of his courage.  And as he went,
gradually the trees grew rarer, and at length he
looked before him, and saw in a clear space a dark
blue forest pool, studded with moon-lotuses, as if
created to mock the expanse of heaven bespangled
with its stars, a mirror formed by Wedasa[<a id="chap0206fn1text"></a><a href="#chap0206fn1">1</a>] to
reproduce another world below.  And all about it flitted
fireflies, looking like swarms of bees that had
returned with torches, unable to endure separation
at night from the lotus flowers which they loved
all day.
</p>

<p>
And as he gazed into the water, he saw in its
smooth mirror the image of a woman, dancing.
And as she danced, her robes of the colour of
grass fluttered in the wind produced by her own
movement over the curves of her limbs; and
drops of water sparkled in the moonlight like gems
on her bosom, which rose and fell like a wave of
the sea in and out of the shadow of her hair: for
that hair resembled a mass of the essence of the
blackness of night.  And she chanted as she danced
with a voice that sounded like a spell, and fanned
the ear like a breeze from the Malaya mountain[<a id="chap0206fn2text"></a><a href="#chap0206fn2">2</a>].
Then Umra Singh raised his eyes, and saw the
original of that water-painted woman-image, dancing
on the other side of the pool.
</p>

<p>
Then she looked across and saw him, and their
eyes met, travelling over the pool.  And instantly
she stopped her singing and dancing, and clapped
her hands, and called to him like a <i>Kokila</i>: Come
over to me, thou handsome stranger, for I am
weary of dancing alone, and I have a question to
ask thee.  And she leaned against a tree and stood
waiting, with one hand on the trunk of the tree
and the other on her hip, and a heaving breast: and
she looked like a feminine incarnation of the essence
of the agitation of the ocean, stirred by the sight
of the moon.  And Umra-Singh looked at her,
and said to himself: Certainly the daughters of
Rákshasas are more dangerous than their fathers.
And now it is well, that I am fenced by the blue
eyes of Shrí like a suit of armour, otherwise the
glances of this forest maiden would like an axe
long ago have cleft my heart in two.
</p>

<p>
Then he went round the edge of the pool, and
found her on the other side.  And she beckoned
to him as he drew near with a bangled hand, and
moving lips, and eyes that shone in the moonlight
like the eyes of a snake.  And she came and stood
before him, and put her hand on his shoulder with
a touch like a leaf, and looked up into his face
with a smile, and said: I am Ulupí, a Daitya's[<a id="chap0206fn3text"></a><a href="#chap0206fn3">3</a>]
daughter, and here I live in the forest alone, with
none to whom to compare myself, save my own
image in the water.  Tell me, for thou hast seen
other women, hast thou ever met with eyes more
beautiful than mine?  And Umra-Singh looked down
into them as into two dark pools, and he felt them
pounding his heart like a pair of fists[<a id="chap0206fn4text"></a><a href="#chap0206fn4">4</a>].  And he
said to himself: She may well ask, and now, but
for one other pair, her eyes need fear no rivals.
But he said to her: Beauty[<a id="chap0206fn5text"></a><a href="#chap0206fn5">5</a>], thine eyes are well
enough: nevertheless the ocean has many gems,
and doubtless each thinks itself the best: but the
Koustubha[<a id="chap0206fn6text"></a><a href="#chap0206fn6">6</a>] is above them all.
</p>

<p>
Then a cloud came over her face, and she flung
away from him in disdain, and stood pouting like
a child.  And suddenly she turned again, and put
up to her head the graceful creepers of her round
arms, and undid the knot of her hair, and shook
it.  And it fell, like midnight, about those stars
her eyes, and wrapped her all over like a veil, and
rolled down round her feet and along the ground,
like a black serpent.  Then with her hand she put it
away from her face, and shot through its meshes
a subtle smile, and said: At least thou hast never
seen the equal of my hair?  And Umra-Singh felt
her glance strike him like a thunderbolt out of
a cloud.  And he said to himself: Well may she
ask; and now, if my soul were not already snared
in the long lashes of the eyes of Shrí, it would be
netted like a quail in this extraordinary mass of
never-ending hair.  But he said: Beauty, lovely
at night is the heaven with its stars, but lovelier
still the dark blue sea, in which they are reflected,
for it contains all their beauty, and adds another
of its own.
</p>

<p>
Then Ulupí was very angry, and she stood with
flashing eyes, swelling with rage.  And suddenly
she stooped, and gathered up her hair in her arm,
and came up to Umra-Singh, and flung it round him
like a noose, and whispered in his ear, with lips that
caressed it as they moved: O foolish bee[<a id="chap0206fn7text"></a><a href="#chap0206fn7">7</a>], I am
but a lotus of the night: yet why despise me, in
comparison with the absent lotus of the day?  It
is hot and dusty, and I am cool and fragrant as
the nectar of that moon in whose light I blow.  And
Umra-Singh trembled.  For there came from her
hair a strange wind, like a cloud of the sweet of a
thousand scents, that lured his soul to listen and
dream in the lulling murmur of her mouth.  And
as he closed his eyes for fear, he saw before him
the blue scorn in the eyes of Shrí, and the sound
of her laughter and the noise of the drums and
the voices of the criers boomed in his ear, and
drowned Ulupí's spell.  And he shook himself free
from her hair, and said: Beauty, I am a Rajpoot
of the race of the Sun: what have I to do with
a lotus of the moon?
</p>

<p>
Then Ulupí screamed, like a wounded elephant.
And she seized him by the arm and shook him
violently, and exclaimed: Hast thou a stone within
thy breast, instead of a heart, that my beauty cannot
touch thee?  For I know that I am beautiful, and
there is not beauty like mine in the three worlds.
And Umra-Singh looked at her, and wondered, for
her fury made her more lovely than before.  And
he said: O daughter of a Daitya, thou speakest the
truth: yet a vessel that is full can hold no more,
be the liquor what it may, and such is my heart.
Let me now pass by thee, as undeserving thy regard:
for I am bound for the Land of the Lotus of the
Sun.  Then said Ulupí, with a stamp of her foot:
Fool! thou shall never see that Lotus Land.
</p>

<p>
And she looked at him with a jeering laugh: and
instantly she sat down, and wound herself up in
her long hair, and began to weep.  And as she
wept, the tears ran down from her eyes like a river,
and fell into the lake.  Immediately the lake began
to rise and swell, and flood the wood with water.
And as Umra-Singh stood gazing at her with
astonishment, he found himself standing in a vast marsh,
with the trees of the forest for rushes.  And he
looked, and lo! suddenly that delusive daughter
of a Daitya became a mist, and floated away over
the water like vapour.  And Umra-Singh heard her
laughter dying away in the distance as she went, and
he was left alone in the wood, with the water up
to his waist.

<br /><br />
The Silver Swans
</h3>

<p>
And as the water kept on rising, rising, Umra-Singh
said to himself: Extraordinary is the guile
of women, and copious their tears, but this daughter
of a Daitya surely surpasses them all.  For who ever
heard of tears that, like rivers, could flood a quarter
of the world?  But in the meanwhile, before I find
my death in these rising waters, it is better to take
refuge in a tree.  So he climbed up into a tree, and
looked out over the water, on which the mist hung
in the moonlight like a curtain of silver on a floor
of lapis-lazuli.  And he said to himself: Is this
merely an illusion, or rather, is not this wood well
named, being in very truth the matted hair of the
great god, with these trees for hairs, and this water
for the Ganges that wanders among them[<a id="chap0207fn1text"></a><a href="#chap0207fn1">1</a>], and
yonder moon the very ornament of the moon-crested
god?  But this water goes on rising, and I must
ascend higher into the tree.
</p>

<p>
So he climbed up, and up, and as he climbed, the
water rose after him, higher and higher, until at last
he could see nothing but the water, and the moon,
and the tree that stretched away above him into the
sky.  And as he went, he said to himself: Up I
must go, for there is no other resource: and now,
unless like the husband of Shrí[<a id="chap0207fn2text"></a><a href="#chap0207fn2">2</a>], I could save myself
on the back of a tortoise from this very sea of water,
I must surely be destroyed.  For unless this
extraordinary tree has no top, I must presently reach
it, and meet with my death at the same time.  And
even without the water, as to how I am to get down
again, I have not an idea.  So he continued to climb
and climb, while the water rose, and the moon sank,
and the night gradually came to an end.
</p>

<p>
And then the sun rose over the eastern mountain,
and began like himself to climb up into the sky.
And the sweat poured from his limbs, and at last
he stopped, overcome with fatigue.  And he said to
himself: Now I can go no further.  Since I must
now in any case perish, why should I go on climbing
in vain?  For surely I am on the very roof of the
world, and alone with the sun in the sky.
</p>

<p>
And as he looked down, suddenly he saw before
him no water and no tree, and his head grew dizzy,
and his vision swam, and he could scarcely believe
his eyes.
</p>

<p>
For he stood on the peak of a high mountain,
in the very zenith of the sky.  And all round him,
and all before him, and behind him, was a vast
desert of burning sand, that stretched away to the
very limit of the range of sight, and on its edges
rested the quarters of heaven.  And it glowed in the
fire of the sun's rays like a furnace, and was furrowed
and pitted with holes and chasms; and its surface
rose and fell, as he watched it, like a woman's breast,
and it looked as if it were alive, though it was in
truth the home of death.  And as he gazed, he saw,
how over it there crawled swiftly living things with
pointed tails, of the colour of sand, which entered
the desert by the holes, and issued from them,
and at length stood still, and became invisible, save
that their tails never rested, and their bright eyes
stood out of the sand to watch.  And it seemed
to Umra-Singh, in the loneliness of that vast
solitude, that all those hideous Eyes sought him out,
and fastened on him, and rested on him alone,
saying to him as it were: Thou canst not escape.
</p>

<p>
And then he said to himself: Now there is
indeed no help for me, and beyond a doubt, my end
has come.  For to remain here is impossible, and
equally certain the death that lies, either in going
forward or going back.  And yet I could wish to
die, if at all, not in the presence of eyes such as
these, but in the colour of the eyes of Shrí.  Yet
how shall I escape the vigilance of yonder dreadful
Dwellers in the Sand, wading with difficulty in its
substance that will sink under my feet like the
waves of the sea, but over which they scud like
the shadow of a cloud?
</p>

<p>
So all day he remained on that high place, not
daring to descend.  And then at length the sun went
to his rest in the western quarter, and the moon rose,
and was reflected in the bright eyes of those
sand-haunting Rákshasas, which glittered in the distance
on the dark desert like drops of water on the leaf
of a black lotus.  And all night long Umra-Singh
lay and watched them, as a bird watches the eyes
of a snake.
</p>

<p>
Then in the early dawn he looked, and as the
light of morning began to glimmer in the distance
on the edge of the world, he saw far away in the
pale air two dark specks in the sky.  And as he
gazed, they grew larger and rapidly approached him,
sending back to him, like mirrors, the red rays
of the rising sun.  And they drew nearer, and he
saw that they were a pair of silver Swans, carrying
in their bills the dead body of a third, of gold.
So these two Swans crossed over that dreadful
desert with the rapidity of the lightning that
resembled them, and settled beside him on the hill,
to rest.
</p>

<p>
Then said Umra-Singh: Hail! ye fair birds:
surely ye are no birds, but deities, fallen into these
bodies of swans by reason of a curse.  Whence
come ye, and whither go ye, and what is this dead
golden body that ye carry as ye go?  Then said
the Swans: We are carrying home the body of our
king, far away to the Mánasa lake.  For he died
yesterday, in the Land of the Lotus of the Sun.
And now we must bear him ever onward swiftly
to his own country, that the funeral ceremonies
may duly be performed.
</p>

<p>
But when Umra-Singh heard them name the
Land of the Lotus, his heart leaped in his breast.
And sword in hand, he rushed on the dead body
with a shout.  And he said to the Swans: As you
carried him hither from that Land of the Lotus
of the Sun, so swear now, that you will carry me
first back thither, leaving him here till you return:
otherwise I will keep him, and cut you to pieces.
</p>

<p>
Then seeing that there was no help for it, the
Swans said: Be it so: and they bound themselves
to him by an oath.  And then Umra-Singh took
hold of them by the neck, one in each hand; and
they stretched out their necks, and flew away with
him over the desert as he hung.  And he left far
behind him the eyes of those hideous Rákshasas
glowing in the sand as if with rage to see him
escape: and after a long while, they came to the
edge of the desert.  And Umra-Singh looked down
and saw, far below him, the blue sea, shimmering
like the eyes of Shrí.  And at a distance in the
water, like a dusky jewel on a purple carpet, he
saw an island, with a city on it.  So he said to the
Swans: What is that which I see below me?  And
they said: It is the Land of the Lotus of the Sun.
</p>

<p>
Then in his delight, Umra-Singh let go his hold,
and clapped his hands.  And instantly he fell down
like a stone into the sea.  But the Swans returned
swiftly over the desert to the body which they had
left upon the hill.

<br /><br />
The Land of the Lotus
</h3>

<p>
But Umra-Singh rose out of the water like a fowl,
and saw the Land of the Lotus away on the sea
before him.  And he shouted for joy, and began
to swim in that direction.  And he swam on all
day, and at last, though with difficulty, he reached
the shore, when his strength was almost gone.  And
he crept up out of the water, as the sun was going
down; and overcome with weariness, he lay down,
there where he came up out of the sea, and fell
asleep.  And all night long he slept, and all day;
and when the moon had risen again, full and round,
as if to see whether he was still there, he awoke.
</p>

<p>
And then he stood up, and rubbed his eyes, and
exclaimed: Ha! now I am at my journey's end,
and all its dangers are gone like dreams.  And this
is that wonderful Land of the Lotus of the Sun,
of which no one in Indirálayá had ever heard!
So now that I am here, what remains for me to do,
but to leave it, and go back again as quickly as
possible.  For I desired to find it, only to say
that I had been there.  And yet when I return,
who will believe me?  It were better, now that I
am here, to examine it, and learn its peculiarities,
that I may not twice meet with the treatment due
to impostors.
</p>

<p>
So he went up from the shore, and through the
streets of the city, that lay before him, black and
white, in the rays of the silver moon.  And he met
nobody, but it was empty, and dark as a barren
womb, and silent as a stone incarnation of the spirit
of death.  And as he wandered up and down, he
came at last to a great palace, whose doors stood
wide open, as much as to say: Come in.  So he
went in, and passed along, wondering, with echoing
steps, from room to room.  Then on a sudden he
entered a door, and found himself in a vast hall,
whose walls were pierced with tall windows, through
which the moonlight fell, cold as camphor, on
moon-stones that hung in clusters from the roof.  And
from them the nectar fell slowly, drop by drop,
upon the floor.  And at the far end of the room,
on a golden couch, he saw lying a dead body,
covered with a white pall.
</p>

<p>
Then he said to himself: What is this wonder,
and who can it be that lies here, alone in this
empty hall?  And he moved on slowly, through
the lights of the windows and the shadows of the
walls, till he came up to the end of the hall, and
stood beside the couch.  And he stooped down,
and lifted up the edge of the pall, and uncovered
the face, and looked, and lo! it was the face of
Shrí.
</p>

<p>
And Umra-Singh was so astounded, that he leaped
into the air, and uttered a cry: and he let his sword
fall with a crash upon the crystal floor.  And he said
to himself: Is it a dream, or is it an illusion?
Lo!  I left her living in Indirálayá, and I have
travelled over the three worlds, and here at the
end of space I find her again, lying dead in this
empty hall!
</p>

<p>
So he stood, like a picture on a wall, gazing in
silence at the face of Shrí, while the night wore
away, and the moon travelled on, and the nectar
from the moonstones fell slowly, drop by drop,
upon the ground, and the shadows moved round
upon the floor.  And at last, after a long while, he
came to himself.  And he let the pall fall from his
hand, recovering the face.  And he stooped down,
and took up his sword, and went slowly out of
that strange hall, and sat down on the steps of a
marble tank, and fell into a waking dream.  And
as he gazed into vacancy, he saw before him the
blue ocean of the eyes of Shrí; and his memory
echoed with faint murmurs of the sound of drums
and the voices of criers; and they filled his soul
with whispers coming from an infinite distance
across the years of separation, until at length the
sun rose.
</p>

<p>
Then Umra-Singh rose up also, and he struck
his forehead with his hand.  And he exclaimed:
I cannot tell, whether it is reality, or whether it is
a dream.  But this I know, that now I must get
back without delay to Indirálayá, and cross, somehow
or other, over that sea, and that terrible desert,
and through that hideous wood, and tell my story
to the King, and claim my bride.  But first I will
bathe in yonder pool: for my heart is heavy, and
my head aches, for all that I have endured during
the night, and all that I have seen.
</p>

<p>
And he went down the steps, and plunged into
the waters of the pool.
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<p><a id="chap0209"></a></p>

<h3>
IX.
<br /><br />
Recognition
</h3>

<p>
And as he rose from the water, there rang in his
ears, loud and clear, the sound of the beating of
drums.  And he listened, and heard the criers
crying: <i>Whatsoever high-caste man has been to the Land
of the Lotus of the Sun, let him come to the King: he
shall share the King's kingdom, and marry the King's
daughter</i>.  And he looked round.  Lo! he was
standing in that very tank in Indirálayá, from which
he had started, years before, to find the Land of
the Lotus of the Sun.  Then in his amazement, his
flesh crept, and his hair stood on end.  And he stood
in the pool like a pillar of stone, with the water
streaming from his body, and doubt bewildering his
soul.  And he said to himself: Is it indeed reality,
or is it a dream?  And what has become of the Land
of the Lotus, and all my toil?  For here I am in
Indirálayá, and there are the very criers whom I
left behind me, crying, and beating, just as they
did before, their drums!
</p>

<p>
And then suddenly he uttered a shout, and
exclaimed: Well, now I will go to the King, for the
time has come to claim the reward.  And he leaped
out of the water, and ran up the steps like one that
is mad, and went up to the criers, and said to them:
Cease this useless crying, and this empty beating
of drums, and take me quickly to the King, for
I have seen that Lotus Land.  And the criers did
not recognise him, but they were full of joy at
hearing his words: for their crying had made them
weary of life.  So as they were preparing to take
him to the King, he clapped his hands, and said
again: Quick! delay not! but make haste, great
haste! or else my heart will break.  For I endured
separation, when union seemed at a distance, with
ease: but now that the moment of re-union
approaches, my heart is breaking: every moment
seems an age: and if you delay long, I cannot
endure.  Then the criers made great haste, and
brought him as quickly as possible to the King.
</p>

<p>
But when the King saw Umra-Singh, he looked
at him narrowly, and knew him again, for all that
he was changed.  And he said to himself: Surely
this is that very rogue, who came to me before to
cheat me; and now, here he is again!  And he said
to Umra-Singh: I know thee, thou impostor.
Beware! for this time thou shalt not escape.  Then
said Umra-Singh: King, be it as thou wilt.  Only
let me see thy daughter, and that quickly: for I
have really seen that Lotus Land: thereafter deal
with me as it may please thee best.  And as he
spoke, ungovernable impatience seized him: and he
stamped his foot upon the ground, and tears came
into his eyes, and suddenly he began to laugh.
And the King looked at him with curiosity, and
wondered at him: and he said to himself: Either
this fellow is mad, or it is as he says, and he has
really seen that Lotus Land.  But he said again to
Umra-Singh: Remember, if this time also thou art
playing false, death is the reward.  Umra-Singh said:
Show me thy daughter, and put me then to any
kind of death.
</p>

<p>
So the King sent for his daughter, and after
a while, Shrí came in.
</p>

<p>
But when Umra-Singh saw her enter, he sobbed
aloud, and strode towards her.  And as she turned
her eyes on him in fear, he plunged his fainting
soul into their azure sea.  And in an instant he
forgot his journey and his toil, and obtained in
that moment the nectar of emancipation from the
hunger of longing, and the pain of separation, and
the terror of untimely death.  And Shrí looked at
him, as he stood before her, and instantly she knew
him again.  And her heart beat in her bosom like
a drum, and she was seized with trembling, and
could not speak, for fear and doubt.  For again the
forgotten ties of her former birth fought for
utterance in her soul, and yet she feared him for his
insolence, and despised him for his poverty: for
he was ten times leaner and more ragged than
before.  And long she looked at him without
speaking.  And then at last she found her voice, and
spoke, and said slowly: What! is it thou, most
doughty traveller?  And hast thou made another
story?  Good it had better be, thy second tale, for
never shall thou live to make a third.
</p>

<p>
But Umra-Singh leaned towards her, with hungry
eyes, for his soul yearned for the repetition of a
forgotten past.  And he looked at her long and
wistfully, till her glance quailed, for her spirit was
mastered by his courage and his love.  And twice
he strove to speak, and twice he failed, while great
tears fell from his eyes upon the ground.  And then
at last, he became master of himself.  And he said:
Dear, now use me as thou wilt, and put me to
any death.  But tell me first, before I die: How
comes it that I see thee here alive, and yet I saw
thee, in that Lotus City, lying dead upon a couch.
in the cold rays of the moon?
</p>

<p>
Then Shrí threw up her arms with a shriek.  And
she cried out: Ha! it is the truth: this man has
really seen the Land of the Lotus of the Sun.  And
suddenly, the veil of oblivion was drawn for an
instant, and she caught a glimpse of her former
birth, and knew her husband again.  And instantly
she ran to him, and threw herself into his arms, and
hung on his breast, and clung to him, like a jasmine
creeper on a noble tree.  And tears fell from her
eyes like rain, and she laughed for joy, and caressed
his face with her hand, and said: Brave heart, and
didst thou dare to go alone to that distant Lotus
Land?  Thou art indeed my own husband, in this
life as in the last.  And now, after long separation,
I have found thee for an instant, and thou hast
me.  Only seek as well again, and we shall meet
once more, and taste yet another drop of the
nectar of mutual enjoyment, before we die: for
so it is decreed.  I say, remember: we shall meet
again.
</p>

<p>
Then she stood up, and pushed him back, so
violently, that he nearly fell.  And all they that
stood by watched her and wondered.  For as they
gazed, she grew in beauty, like a waxing moon, and
flashed like a great jewel, and dazzled the eyes of
all like the brightness of a lamp: and the colour
of her wondrous eyes shot from them and streamed
about the room, and lit up its walls with glory
like that of a setting sun.  And seeing it, the King
her father was full of joy, for he thought: Now she
is going to be married, and I have attained the fruit
of my birth.  But the astrologers looked at each
other in dismay, for they knew that she was about
to die.  So as they gazed, suddenly she drooped
and fell, and lay before them on the floor, like
a lotus smitten by the frost.
</p>

<p>
Then the astrologers said, gloomily: She has
abandoned the body, and gone somewhere else.
And the King, seeing her fall, and hearing them
speak, lost his senses, and fell down beside her in
a swoon.  But Umra-Singh turned, and left the
palace, and went out into the street.
</p>

<br /><br />
Separation
</h3>

<p>
And he reeled about like a drunken man, this
way and that way, jostling the people, who
marvelled and mocked at him: See, see, the ragged
Rajpoot, the suitor of the King's daughter, whose
very sight has killed her!  But he heard nothing
but the words of Shrí, and saw nothing but her
eyes.  And he staggered on, like a wooden doll,
on feet that moved of their own accord, till as
before he reached the tank, and sank down upon the
ground, knowing neither where he was nor what
he did, puzzled about the quarters of the world[<a id="chap0210fn1text"></a><a href="#chap0210fn1">1</a>].
And like a man, out of whose universe the sun
and moon and the five elements with their
compounds have withdrawn, leaving him alone in the
centre of empty space, he lay motionless, plunged
in stupor, with dry eyes.  Then all at once memory
returned to him, and he began to weep.  And he
wept, as if he contained within him the very fountains
of the salt sea, till at last from weariness and
grief he fell asleep on the edge of the tank.  And
in his dreams Shrí stood beside him, and revived
his parched soul with the nectar of her kindly
glance, as a hermit's daughter refreshes with water
the plants of the hermitage committed to her charge.
</p>

<p>
And after drinking deep draughts from those two
fountains of pity and love, he awoke, and found
that it was now night, and again he was alone at
the moonlit tank.  And he said to himself:
Alas! alas!  I found my bride, and lost her again at the
same instant, through the terrible operation of sins
committed in a former birth.  Now indeed I am
alone, for this time she is gone I know not where,
and how am I to look for her?  And yet she told
me we should meet again, to keep me from despair.
Therefore now I will wander away over the wide
world, and spend my life in seeking her: for but
this, nothing is left in life, and the hope of reunion
is like the back of the Great Tortoise, my solitary
refuge in the wreck of the three worlds.
</p>

<p>
So he rose up, and went out of the city, and
wandered about, hither and thither, like a bubble
on the waves of time.  And he went from village
to village, and from city to city, asking everywhere
of all whom he met: Have you seen Shrí, my wife? you
will know her by her eyes, for they are full
of the colour of heaven.  But however much he
asked, he found no answer: nor could anyone tell
him anything about her.  On the contrary, all
wondered at him and turned him to ridicule.  And one
would say: Who is this moon-struck vagabond who
roams about looking for a blue-eyed beauty?  And
another: What wonder that Shrí has deserted such
a ragged mendicant, who forsakes even the
well-to-do!  And others said: This distracted Rajpoot
wants the moon, but he needs medicines[<a id="chap0210fn2text"></a><a href="#chap0210fn2">2</a>].  And
at last he abandoned altogether the dwellings of
men, and wandered continually in the jungle, with
no companions but his shadow and his sword, looking
in vain for the path by which he had gone on
his former journey to the Land of the Lotus, and
gazing by day at the pools of blue lotuses, and by
night at the heaven with its stars, for they were
like mirrors and images of the hues and shadows
of the eyes of Shrí.

<br /><br />
The Lord of the Beasts
</h3>

<p>
Now in the meanwhile it happened that Maheshwara,
as he roamed through the sky with Párwati
on his breast, looked down to earth, and caught
sight of Umra-Singh wandering in the forest,
uttering lamentations, and exclaiming: O Shrí, where
art thou hiding?  Hast thou, like the desert, no
pity for the antelope that is dying of thirst for the
water of thine eyes[<a id="chap0211fn1text"></a><a href="#chap0211fn1">1</a>]?  And immediately he
remembered his boon to Kamalamitra, and grasped the
whole story from beginning to end.  So he said
to Umá with a smile: Go now to thy father[<a id="chap0211fn2text"></a><a href="#chap0211fn2">2</a>], and
wait for me: for there is here a matter that demands
my attention.  Then his consort said to him in a
cajoling tone: What is the matter? tell me.
Maheshwara said: I will tell thee afterwards: at
present I have no leisure: depart.  Thereupon the
goddess went off pouting to the Snowy Mountain.
But the moon-crested god descended to earth.  And
there, taking the form of an ascetic, he entered the
forest.  And standing in its densest part, his body
white with ashes, garlanded with a necklace of
skulls, with a half-moon in his yellow hair, he
created by his supernatural power a gong, hanging
from a banyan tree in the centre of the wood.
And he struck with his trident a blow on that
mind-born gong that resounded through the forest
like thunder.
</p>

<p>
Then instantly, hearing that terrible summons, all
the denizens of the wood, Yakshas and Pisháchas,
Rákshasas and Hamadryads, with the wild animals
and the rest, assembled together and flew towards
the sound, and crowded around the gong like flies
or bees to honey or a dead body.  And when they
had mustered, they enquired humbly of that Lord
of Creatures animate and inanimate: What orders
has the Lord of All for his servants, and why are
we now summoned?  Then said the Great Ascetic:
There is in this wood a lover looking for his bride.
And she on her part will sometime or other be
here to join him.  See that none of you do them
actual harm, by devouring or destroying them:
for they are to work out their redemption in the
wood, by the decree of destiny and my will and
pleasure[<a id="chap0211fn3text"></a><a href="#chap0211fn3">3</a>].  For they fell under a curse, and so
became mortals: but when they meet here, and the
circumstances are favourable, their curse will have
an end.  Therefore delude them if you will, but
beware that you touch not a hair of their heads.
</p>

<p>
Thus he spoke, and all assented, prostrating
themselves at his feet.  And then he began to dance.
Then all joined furiously in the festival of his
favour, seized with the madness born of devotion,
uttering ecstatic hymns of praise, each in his own
language.  So after that he had sported sufficiently,
and bestowed on those adorers the nectar of his
presence, that Lord whose left half is his wife
remembered his promise to the Daughter of the
Mountain, and returned to the snowy peak of
Kailàs, to tell her the story and coax away her
sulks.

<br /><br />
The Other Body
</h3>

<p>
But in the meanwhile Shrí[<a id="chap0212fn1text"></a><a href="#chap0212fn1">1</a>], when she abandoned
the body in Indirálayá, flew in the twinkling of
an eye to the Land of the Lotus of the Sun.
And there she entered that other body, lying in
a couch in the Palace hall.  Then instantly she
opened her eyes, and rose up, as if awaking from
a dream.  And she was filled with astonishment,
terror, and dismay, when she found herself alone in
the empty hall.  And she exclaimed: Alas! what is
this mystery, and how came I into this deserted
hall, and in which quarter of the world am I, and
what has become of my husband?  Now do I see
the terrible consequences of sins committed in a
former birth.  Alas! how am I to regain him, and
where is he to be found?  Surely we are like two
tiny fishes in the infinite ocean of time.  Yet even
so, despair is unavailing.  Did not Sítá recover
Ráma, and Shakuntalá, Dushyanta, and Damayanti
cross the ocean of separation, and repose on the
shore in the shape of the embraces of Nala?  Truly
omnipotent is the power of love, and what love
was ever greater than mine?  For it passes on from
body to body, and draws fresh fire from each new
birth.
</p>

<p>
Then she dressed herself in the white pall[<a id="chap0212fn2text"></a><a href="#chap0212fn2">2</a>], and
went hastily out of that empty palace, shrinking
like a fawn at the echo of her own footsteps, and
passed out of the gates, and ran through the deserted
streets, down to the very edge of the sea.  And there
she stood with her bare feet lapped by the waves,
looking out eagerly over the sea, with eyes that
laughed at and shamed it of its blue.  And it rose
in agitation at her beauty, as if stirred by the moon,
while the wind kissed her unaware, and played with
her hair and clothes.  Then she said: O Ocean,
art thou too parted from someone, that thou heavest
long drawn sighs?  Art thou also wrenched with
grief, that thou sprinklest me with the salt tears of
thy spray?
</p>

<p>
And as she gazed, there appeared tossing on the
waves a ship, like the realization of her desire to
cross the ocean in visible form.  Now that ship
belonged to a great merchant captain, who was
returning home from a trading voyage.  And when
he saw a female figure standing alone on the shore,
he came quickly in a boat to take her captive.
But when he got to the shore, and saw the
wonderful beauty of her dark blue eyes and snow white
raiment, he was struck with wonder, and became
afraid.  And he said to her in awe: Surely thou
art some divinity, and no mere mortal maiden.
Tell me thy name, that I may know whom to
adore.  Then said Shrí: Sir, I am no divinity, but
a king's daughter; and I am seeking for my
husband.  Carry me, of your kindness, over the sea,
for I must find my way to Indirálayá.  But
hearing this, that merchant was overjoyed; for he
thought: Indirálayá is in another quarter of the
world, and I will be her husband.  For he was
drowned in the ocean of her eyes.  So he said to
her: O thou true daughter of a King, my ship is
thine and all that it contains.  Come now, and I
will carry thee whithersoever thou wilt.  So Shrí
consented.  And the merchant in his delight
counted the whole world as a straw, thinking he
had got her for a wife.
</p>

<p>
So when he got to the ship, he said to her: Truly
this husband of thine is a sorry rascal.  Out upon
him, who could leave such an incomparable beauty
as thine to roam about the world without him!
Forget him now, for I will be thy husband.  Then
said Shrí: This is impiety, nor is my husband to
blame in this matter.  Know, too, that to a good
wife her husband is a deity.  Then said the
merchant: Thou shalt marry me whether thou wilt or
not: and I care nothing for piety or impiety, but
only for thy wonderful eyes.  And now I have thee,
I will keep thee.  So he carried her in his ship, very
carefully, closely guarded, to his own city, and shut
her in an upper chamber of his house, hoping to
prevail on her in course of time, neglecting his
affairs.
</p>

<p>
Then Shrí said to herself: Alas for my beauty,
which is a curse and no blessing to me, in that it
has placed me in the power of this headstrong
merchant!  Nevertheless, even so, I have got over
the sea.  And now, I must lose no time in escaping
from this infatuated sinner, or worse things may
come about.  And she went to the window and
looked out.  Now by the ordinance of fate it so
happened, that at that moment the King of that
city was passing by on his elephant.  So when she
saw it, Shrí said to herself: There is my deliverance
in the form of an elephant.  And now I must
sin a little, to save myself from greater guilt.  Then
she called to the <i>mahout</i>: Come nearer, O driver
of the elephant: for I am anxious to taste the
delight of riding on an elephant.  And hearing this,
the mahout looked at the King.  And the King
looked at the face of Shrí.  And Shrí shot at the
King a blue glance from her eye.  And instantly
the King lost his senses, and said to the <i>mahout</i>:
Do as she bids thee.  So the <i>mahout</i> brought the
elephant under the window, and Shrí let herself
fall from the window on to his back.  And she
caught hold of the King to save herself from
falling, and the King almost fainted from excess of
joy, and the nectar of her touch.  And without
losing a moment, he carried her off to his palace,
as delighted as if he had conquered the whole
earth.  But the merchant, when he found that she
had gone, abandoned the body in his despair.
</p>

<p>
Then as soon as they reached the palace, the
King said to Shrí: What is thy name and family?
Shrí said: I am a King's daughter from a far
country, and my name is Shrí.  Then said the
King: Thou didst well to forsake that miserable
trader for me.  Should the lioness, forsooth! mate
with the jackal?  And now will I place thee, like
a choice jewel, in the centre of my diadem, and
thou shall be the very apex of the summit of my
fortune[<a id="chap0212fn3text"></a><a href="#chap0212fn3">3</a>].  Then said Shrí: King, do not speak thus.
For I am the wife of another.  And I fled to thee
for refuge, and not for frivolity: for yonder
merchant would have made me his wife by force.  So
do me justice, and let me go: for I may not be
a wife to thee.
</p>

<p>
Then said the King: Thy dark blue eyes have
utterly destroyed my sense of right and wrong, which
are now mere words without meaning, impotent to
hold me as is a lotus stalk to fetter that elephant
which brought thee hither; and in vain dost thou
talk to me of letting thee go: thou askest me for
my life: for till I saw those unfathomable blue lakes
which thou hast stolen to make thee eyes, I never
lived.  Only consent, and I will efface by my
devotion the memory of thy husband, as the sun dries
up a shallow pool.  But Shrí said: Say not pool, but
ocean, on which the sun shines for ever, yet never
makes it any less: for such is my love to my
husband.  But the King paid no heed to her words,
which entered at his ear, but never reached his mind.
For all his soul was in his eyes, feasting on the face
of Shrí, which made him drunk like the juice of
Soma[<a id="chap0212fn4text"></a><a href="#chap0212fn4">4</a>].
</p>

<p>
Then seeing the state of the case, Shrí said to
herself: Alas!  I have escaped the lesser danger only to
incur the greater, and become the prey of this
unrighteous King.  Now there is no help for me, save in
stratagem, and the natural craft of woman.  And she
lifted up her lashes, and cast on the King a crooked
glance, that almost deprived him of his reason.  And
she said, moving her bow-arched eyebrows, with a
smile: Out upon the heart of woman, for it is soft
as a flower, and averse to constancy!  Leave me
awhile, for I must consider this matter.  And yet,
stay not away too long, for thou art good to look
upon, and well-fitted to be my husband, were I not
already the wife of another man.  But hearing this,
the King was utterly bewildered, and doubted the
testimony of his ears.  And he thought: Now she
will consent, after a little coaxing.  And he looked
at her as she stood smiling at him, bowing like
a flower from the weight of her bosom and the
slenderness of her waist, and laughed in his intoxication,
befooled by the roundness of her limbs and the
blueness of her eyes, and forgetting that the Creator
made woman to be an instrument of delusion, with
an exterior of honey and an interior of poison.  And
he left her to perform his kingly duties, intending to
return without delay, and thinking the fruit of his
birth attained.
</p>

<p>
But as soon as he was gone, Shrí summoned
a chamberlain, and said to him: Take me to the
Head Queen, and lose not a moment, or it will be
the worse for thee.  And that chamberlain trembled
and obeyed her, for he feared her power, saying
to himself: The King would throw his kingdom
into the sea for a glance from her eye, and now my
life is on her forefinger.  So when Shrí came before
the Queen, she said to her: Lady, thou art my sole
refuge.  Know, that the King thy husband found
me to-day in the city, and stole me away, seeking
to make me his wife.  Now contrive my escape,
for I am the wife of another, and I may not be
his wife.  And do it very quickly, for this is an
opportunity which will never occur again.  Then
the Queen looked at her, and said to herself: She
says well, and I must indeed send her away without
losing a moment.  For if she remains here, and
becomes his wife, the King will abandon everything
for her sake, and the state will go to ruin.
Moreover, he will never again have anything to do with
me or any other of his queens: for her beauty is
like a very feminine incarnation of the five arrows
of the god of love.
</p>

<p>
So she summoned her confidential women; and
they disguised Shrí as a dancing girl, and conveyed
her secretly out of the palace without delay.  But
when the King returned, and found that she was
gone, he became mad.  And he put to death, of
his retainers, everything that was male.

The Light in Darkness
</h3>

<p>
But Shrí, when she got out of the palace, instantly
went out of the city by unfrequented paths,
and entered the Great Forest.  For she said to herself:
If I remain in the city, I may fall again into the
power of the King, or, it may be, of someone still
worse.  For alas! every man that sees me is blinded
by my eyes, and I shall not always find a door of
escape from persecution.  Moreover, to beauty without
its guardian, wild beasts are less dangerous than
men with souls through the influence of passion
worse than those of beasts.  Better far to be
devoured by an animal, than become perforce the wife
of another man.
</p>

<p>
So she went on through the forest for many days,
supporting her life on roots and fruits and the water
of the pools and streams.  And she tore her clothes
to pieces in the bushes, and pierced her feet with
their thorns, leaving where she passed on the grass
drops of blood, like rubies, mingled with the pearls
of her tears that fell beside them, as often as she
thought of her absent husband.  And the deeper
she went into the wood, the more her spirit sank,
and the more her soul longed for the nectar of
her husband's arms.  Alas! the courage of women
is but a pale and lunar image in the mirror of
that of men, and vanishes in their absence.  And
at last there came a day when she was seized with
panic, and a fear of unknown evil: and she sank
down at the foot of a tree, and watered its roots with
her tears.
</p>

<p>
Now it happened, that some Bhillas, hunting, by
the decree of destiny, in the forest, came upon her
track, and saw the drops of blood upon the leaves.
And they followed them up, saying to themselves:
Some wounded animal has passed this way.  So
as they came along, every now and then they
stopped and listened.  And suddenly, they heard
the sound of the voice of a woman, weeping in the
wood.  Then full of astonishment, they proceeded
in the direction of the sound: and all at once they
saw Shrí, sitting under a tree, looking like an
incarnation of Rati grieving for her husband, when
burned by Maheshwara[<a id="chap0213fn1text"></a><a href="#chap0213fn1">1</a>].  For her clothes were torn,
and her hair was dishevelled, and her great eyes
filled with tears resembled the petals of a blue lotus
sparkling with drops of water cast upon them by the
sporting of swans in a pool.  So those wild Bhillas
wondered when they saw her, and said to each
other: What is this marvel of a dancing girl, so
ragged and so beautiful, weeping alone in the wood?
And then they went up to her and stood round
her in a ring.  And she looked in the midst of those
black barbarians like a digit of the moon in the
jaws of Ráhu.  Then after a while the spell of her
beauty entered and poisoned the hearts of those
Bhillas, like one of their own arrows.  And each
one said secretly to himself: She shall be my wife.
So they debated about her, and proposed to each
other to draw lots for her.  But they could not
agree about it, and fell to quarrelling, and it was
as if a stone had been dropped into a nest of
serpents.
</p>

<p>
Then one laid hands upon her, and then another,
till she was nearly torn in pieces.  And finally they
came to blows, and fought for her over her body,
filled by the frenzy begotten by her beauty, and
the desire of exclusive possession[<a id="chap0213fn2text"></a><a href="#chap0213fn2">2</a>].  And very soon
they were all either dead or dying of wounds, for
each was more eager to destroy another than to
protect himself: and they lay all about her unable
to move.  Then Shrí, seizing her opportunity, and
urged by terror, rose up and fled away from them,
being sprinkled by their blood, mingled with her
own, for she had received in the struggle a blow
from a Bhilla that was meant for another.  And
she ran on, stumbling over roots and creepers in
her haste, till she came at last to a forest pool.  And
there she lay down at the edge of the water and
drank greedily; and afterwards washed her wound
and stains, and bathed her feet, and overcome by
weariness, fell asleep.  Then the moon rose, and
stole through the trees and kissed her with beams
that trembled with admiration[<a id="chap0213fn3text"></a><a href="#chap0213fn3">3</a>]; and the wild
animals came down, one by one, to drink at the
pool, and obedient to the commands of Triambaka,
did her no harm, but licked her feet and hands as
she lay.
</p>

<p>
Now, as fate would have it, this was the very
pool, at which Umra-Singh had met with Ulupí,
the daughter of the Daitya.  And in course of the
night, Ulupí came herself to the pool, to dance and
sport according to her wont.  And when she arrived,
she saw Shrí, lying asleep by the pool.  So she
came and stood over her, and marvelled at the
beauty of her limbs, even though her eyes were
shut.  And at last, out of curiosity, she touched her
on the bosom with her finger, saying to herself:
Is this an illusion, or is it a real woman, and is she
dead or alive?  But Shrí shuddered at her touch,
for it suggested evil to her sleeping soul.  And she
opened her eyes, and their deep blue awoke the
envy of the daughter of the Daitya, and astonished
her even more than before.
</p>

<p>
Then they looked at each other, like light and
darkness, and each wondered at the loveliness of the
other, forgetful of her own.  And at last Ulupí said:
Who art thou, and what is thy name and family, and
whence hast thou come to my pool, and why?  Shrí
said: I am a King's daughter, looking for my
husband, whom I lost, by the operation of crimes in
a former birth, at the very moment that I found
him again, after that he had returned to me from
the Land of the Lotus of the Sun.  But when Ulupí
heard her, she was filled with sudden rage and
malice.  And she said to herself: Ha! so this is
that absent lotus of the day, by reason of whom
my beauty was scorned, and set at nought by the
handsome stranger who saw me dancing by my pool.
And instantly she started up, and assuming a terrific
form, she gnashed at Shrí with teeth like saws, and
made horrible grimaces at her, saying: Wretch, thou
shalt never quit this wood, but wander for ever with
thy accursed beauty among its trees, haunted and
beset by hideous illusions till thou shalt long for
death.  Let thy absent husband save thee if he
can.  And she vanished with a peal of laughter,
leaving Shrí fainting by the pool.
</p>

<p>
But Ulupí flew through the wood, and found
Nightwalker, the old Wairágí, and told him all,
and begged of him a boon, saying: Torment this
miserable mortal woman, and deceive her with
illusions for she has done me deadly injury.
And Nightwalker rejoiced at the opportunity, for
he remembered how Umra-Singh had defied him,
and cut off his tongue in the wood.  But he said:
This is no easy matter, for we are forbidden by
Pashupati to do her harm.  But though I will do
her no injury, I will delude this wandering wife of
a vile husband, till she will desire to abandon the
body of her own accord.

Illusion
</h3>

<p>
But Shrí, when she came to herself, sat weeping,
and fearing for herself in the future: for she
foreboded evil from the malicious pranks of the daughter
of the Daitya.  And yet she could not tell, how she
could possibly have offended her, or deserved her
anger.  And as soon as day broke, she rose up, and
began to go trembling through the wood, in which
the shadows of night still hung among the trees,
starting at the noise of the falling leaves, and
yearning for emancipation from danger in the form of
her husband's presence.
</p>

<p>
Then after a while, she stopped and listened:
for she heard among the trees steps, as of one
coming in her direction.  And her heart beat
violently, as if to say: Let me abandon thy body,
and so escape the danger coming on thee.  So she
hid herself in a hollow tree, and peeped out in
terror.  And suddenly, strange! there in the dim
twilight she saw her husband coming towards her,
looking just as he did, when she left him in the
palace at Indirálayá.  And instantly she ran
towards him, overcome by emotion and great surprise,
and caught him in her arms, exclaiming: At last,
at last, I have found thee again.  And she wept
aloud, and forgot in that moment all her sorrow;
and she looked at him, and laughed for joy, and
closed her eyes, as if, like the sun, the sight of him
dimmed and overcame the faculty of vision.  Then
after a while, she opened them again, and started
and shrieked, and her blood became ice, and her
heart stopped.  For he that held her in his arms
was not her husband, but a hairy thing with hideous
eyes, that resembled an incarnation of the brute
in human shape; and it fastened those fearful eyes
upon her own, and laughed and whined and panted
like a beast with hot quick breath into her face.
Then her senses abandoned her, like cowards, and
she sank down to the earth in a swoon.
</p>

<p>
And when at length she revived, she looked,
and saw that the sun was declining in the western
quarter.  But the moon had not yet risen, for it
was the beginning of the dark half of the month.
Then all at once memory came back to her, and
she shook with agitation.  And she said to herself:
Was it a reality, or was it only an evil dream?
Surely it was but a dream; for I am very weak
and tired.  And even now I cannot tell, whether
I wake or sleep.
</p>

<p>
So she sat with her eyes closed; fearing to open
them, lest she should see she knew not what among
the shadows of the trees.  And then the waning
moon rose, and poured through the interstices of
the leaves beams faint and pallid, as if sharing her
own terror.  And at last, unable to endure any
longer the silence and the solitude, she rose up
and began to move slowly, with hesitating steps,
through the dark wood, not knowing where to
go, yet not daring to stay where she was.
</p>

<p>
And suddenly, as she went, she looked before
her, and there, in an open space, again she saw
her husband, lying still under a tree.  Instantly
she stopped, and stood, balanced in the swing of
vacillation.  For the joy of reunion, and the desire
of safety, and the fear of solitude drew her towards
him like a threefold cord: while the memory of her
deception, and the fear of illusion, and the
anticipation of unknown danger, fixed her to the ground
like roots.  And she wavered and swayed on her
feet, like a young shoot fanned by opposing breezes:
while large tears fell from her eyes, like drops of
camphor from a moonstone[<a id="chap0214fn1text"></a><a href="#chap0214fn1">1</a>].  And as she stood
there doubting whether he were dead or alive, for
his face was wan in the light of the pallid moon,
his eyes opened, and met her own.  And he sprang
up, and ran towards her, while she remained unable
to stir, and took her in his arms, while she shrank
from his embrace.  And he exclaimed: The sight
of thee has lifted me out of the mouth of death, for
I had determined to abandon the body.  And then
he said again: Alas! and why, O thou of the lovely
eyes, dost thou shrink from me?  But Shrí remained
silent, torn by suspicion, and shaken by the beating
of her own heart.  And ever and anon she raised
her eyes, and looked at him in doubt.  And then at
last she said slowly: Art thou indeed my husband? is
it really thyself and no one else?  Then he said:
What is thy question or thy doubt?  Hast thou
forgotten me already?  Surely it is but a little while
since I lost thee in the palace of Indirálayá.  Then
said Shrí, sighing: There came to me but now
one who resembled thee in every feature, and
deceived me: and even now, I shudder when I think
of it, lest thou too should be another such as he.
</p>

<p>
Then he said: Dear, thou art weak, and a dream
has deceived thee: but this time, it is no dream.
Know that I am none other than myself, and thou
art with me.  Let me dispel thy terror with a kiss.
And he bent down, and she raised her face with
a smile, saying to herself: It was nothing but
a dream.  But even as she touched his face, it
changed, and became gigantic and misshapen, with
a large tongue that hung out of lips that resembled
those of a cow; and it broke out into loud laughter,
and disappeared.  But Shrí fell to the ground, as if
menaced by the outstretched forefinger of death.

<a id="chap0214fn1"></a>
[<a href="#chap0214fn1text">1</a>] The Hindoos have a superstition, illustrated in a previous
page, that moonstones in the rays of the moon distil a sort
of lunar syrup, nectar or camphor, supposed to be composed
of the substance of the moon.

The Dead of Night
</h3>

<p>
So she lay, all night long: and when at length
the day dawned, she came, though with difficulty,
back to herself.  And she tried to rise, but could
not, for her limbs refused to do their duty.  So
she lay there, cold as snow, and shivering like the
surface of a lake ruffled by the wind.
</p>

<p>
Then gradually the sun left his home in the
eastern mountain, and ascended the sky.  And
warmed by his beams, a little of her strength
returned: and after a while, she rose to her feet,
which wandered away, and carried her where they
would, until they brought her to another forest
pool.  And there she lay down, and leaned and
drank of its water.  And she looked into its mirror,
and saw herself, slender and emaciated as the old
moon, but pale and colourless as that moon at
mid-day[<a id="chap0215fn1text"></a><a href="#chap0215fn1">1</a>].  And her long hair fell down over her
shoulder into the water.  Then she bound up that
wet hair into a knot, and remained all day by the
pool, not endeavouring to go further: for she said
to herself: Rather let me stay here to perish of
hunger, or furnish myself food to some wild beast,
than continue my journey through a wood filled
with illusions worse than a hundred deaths.  For
they wear the guise of a friend, and so finding
entrance into my heart sting it like serpents, turning
into poison the nectar of him whom most of all I
long to see.  Surely my sins in a former birth were
terrible in their enormity: for I have suffered in this
existence pain sufficient for many lives.  And now
I feel that I cannot long endure, for my strength is
becoming exhausted.  O that I could indeed find
my husband, were it only to die in his arms!
</p>

<p>
So she sat by the pool, grieving like a female
<i>chakrawáka</i> for her mate, while the sun made,
like the enemy of Bali, but three steps over the sky.
And when at last he sank, she also grew weary,
and fell asleep on the edge of the pool.  And in
her dreams she saw her husband, and drank her
fill of the nectar of his embraces.  And then, in
the dead of night, she awoke, and sat up, and
looked, and lo! there in the moonlight she saw
him again, silently sitting beside her.  And she
leaped to her feet in agony, and turned to fly, and
screamed aloud.  For there stood before her another
husband on the other side.  Then suddenly the
whole wood was full of laughter.  And her reason
fled, and she became mad.  And she exclaimed:
Out on this wood, for it is full of husbands!  And
she began to run through the wood, shutting her
eyes, and stopping her ears.
</p>

<p class="footnote">
<a id="chap0215fn1"></a>
[<a href="#chap0215fn1text">1</a>] The same idea is beautifully put by Butler in Hudibras,
where he calls the sun's light on the moon a

Before Dawn
</h3>

<p>
And now, by the decree of destiny, it so happened,
that Umra-Singh, having wandered through
the whole world looking for his wife, roaming up
and down in the forest, was lying asleep in
another place, close to that very pool.  And suddenly
he laughed in his sleep.  For in his dreams he had
found again the Land of the Lotus of the Sun.
And he stood once more in the moonlit hall, beside
the golden couch.  Then slowly, slowly, he raised
the pall, and looked long at the face of Shrí.  But
as he gazed, it became apeish, and stuck out at him
a large red tongue.  And he saw before him, not
Shrí, but the old Wairágí.  Then a shout of laughter
rang in his ears, mingled with the voices of criers
and the din of drums; and he started to his feet
awake, with an icy sweat on his brow.
</p>

<p>
And as he stood there, doubting still, for the
laughter in his waking ears, whether he woke or
slept, he looked before him, and saw in the
moonlight the figure of a woman, running towards him:
and instantly he knew her to be Shrí.  For out of
the shadow of her floating hair her great eyes
glittered in the moon like the blade of his own sword,
and flashed into the night before her like lightning
from a dark blue cloud.  And he ran to meet
her with a shout of joy.  But Shrí, when she saw
him coming, stopped short, and began to laugh like
one possessed by a vampire.  And crying: What,
another! she turned and fled away from him faster
than ever, covering her eyes with her hands.
But Umra-Singh was so astonished, that he stood
like a tree, rooted to the ground: saying to himself:
Is it reality, or is it a dream?  Yonder she flies
from me in terror as if I were an enemy.
</p>

<p>
And then, seized with frenzy, he began to pursue
her, calling aloud: Shrí!  Shrí!  So they ran
through the wood in the moonlight, in and out
of the trees, like a spotted panther and a black
antelope.  And suddenly, Shrí slipped and fell.
And a tawny lion leaped out of the wood, before
the eyes of Umra-Singh, and stood over her as
she lay.  Then Umra-Singh turned white with
fear, and uttered a groan.  And in a moment he
reached them as he ran, and struck at the lion,
with all his force, a blow of his sword.  Then
lo! that phantom lion vanished, for he was but an
illusion of the crafty Nightwalker.  But the sword
fell, sharp and true, on the shoulder of Shrí, and
cut through to her heart.
</p>

<p>
Then Umra-Singh fell on his knees beside her
with a wail, and took his darling in his arms,
while her blood gushed out over him like a river,
carrying away her life.  And as his hot tears fell on
her face like rain, Shrí opened her dying eyes: and
instantly they were full of peace, for she knew that
it was her husband at last.  And she said slowly:
Weep not for me, O my lord, for I have attained the
emancipation of union with thee.  All day long,
I have sought thee: but I have found thee in
the evening, before my sun goes down: that is
enough.
</p>

<p><a id="chap03"></a></p>

<h2>
Dawn.
</h2>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p>
And at that very moment, the curse came to an
end.  Then those two erring lovers regained their
immortal natures.  And they looked at one another,
dazed and bewildered, for they thought that they had
awoken from a dream.  And their spirits rose out
of those mortal bodies which they had abandoned,
and soared away to their heavenly home, locked in
each other's arms.
</p>

<p>
But Maheshwara, from his seat on Kailàs, saw
them go.  And perceiving all, by the power of his
mystical intuition, he said to himself: There are
those two foolish lovers rejoicing to have awoken
from a dream; not knowing that it was but a dream
within a dream, and that they are still asleep.  And
he laughed aloud: and the thunder of the shout of
his laughter rolled and reverberated, and rattled in
the blue hollows of Himálaya, like the sound of
a drum.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
